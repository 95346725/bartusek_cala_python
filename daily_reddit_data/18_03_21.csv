m7id8j,,stocks,post,1616039228,"Why you shouldn’t use RobinhoodI’ve seen a ton of posts from newer investors on what brokerages to use, and I want to be clear on why you shouldn’t use RH:

Who is their customer and what is their product?

RH would say the customer is you, the retail investor... but don’t customers give money for services?  Oh, right, they make money from order flow... that means their real customer is Citadel.

What does that make retail investors?  The product.  Just like FB and others, you are essentially the product that is being pawned around, except in this case, you have your own dollars at stake.

Is this necessarily bad?  Depends.  But if you are not their customer, you are likely not getting the attention you deserve as an investor.  The sleek look and ease to use is just to make the product more lucrative for their actual clients.

Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company.  Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.

IRA?  Sorry.  I haven’t looked into why specifically, but it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.  If you were actually RH’s customer, why wouldn’t they offer you one of the best and most trusted retirement vehicles in this country?

Customer Service - never used it, but again, it’s a tech company... when have you ever got on the phone with google?

Leadership - the congressional hearings were pathetic... what is core to leadership?  Seeking responsibility for your actions.  This ceo needs to hire someone else to be the point man, he isn’t ready for the big leagues.

Many more points, but I’m getting angry just typing this.  Let’s keep brewing the hate.",['FB']

I'm sure there's plenty of bearish cases for PLTR, but looking historically, the price tends to float between 24 and 26 when it's doing nothing, and could probably hit 30 on a good day, but if you want to stock up on shares, and there's no news, you should try to buy your shares between this range. If you get in under 24, you're doing very well, but even between this range, you'll be profitable in the future.

m7qyyy,,stocks,post,1616074634,"NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investmentI bought NVDA today, adding to a position I’d initiated in 2018 and have continuously added to on most dips. 

**The Bull Case**

* A great long term investment as demand for GPU’s will remain high for the next decade
* User markets such as data center, gaming and auto continue to grow
* Leader in its market segments – best in class products
* Gaming - Huge pricing power because of innovative, high quality product improvements such as ray tracing
* Strong competitive advantage with its CUDA software stack
* Mellanox acquisition also gives it a serious competitive advantage in Data Center
* 15% Rev and 20% earnings growth expected per year in the next 5 years.
* The ARM deal, if it goes through will be a huge shot in the arm for NVDA as a strategic near monopoly in licensing 
* NVDA has bought a majority of ARM with its own stock at $485 per share. The equity dilution is only 7%.

**The Bear Case**

* Stretched valuation at 40X Jan -22 earnings and 20X Jan-22 sales 
* Data center GPU users such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily to build their own chips. 
* Crypto revenue is not sustainable 
* Post covid environment may reduce gaming and therefore GPU demand

**Challenges**

The ARM deal may not go through

The chances of several governments, especially the U.K and China passing the deal are low.  Several ARM customers have raised concerns about Nvidia likely misusing/abusing its position as the default licensor, forcing customers to use  its own chips.

With these concerns there will be heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny into NVDA.

There are two interesting articles on the ARM deal. [Here’s the one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/03/11/why-the-nvidia-arm-acquisition-should-be-approved/?sh=44c39eac45b2)–  the author is hopeful that the deal goes through and why. She believes that governments like the US will push through to gain and maintain its competitive advantage in A.I.

The second is from Trading Places Research and called Nvidia and ARM: All About Control. It’s from Seeking Alpha and why the ARM acquisition makes sense for NVIDIA. Here’s the gist in the author’s own words.

>“But in the end, NVIDIA is trying to do what Apple does regularly, and is so very successful with: control the core technologies behind its products. NVIDIA wants to build a data center behemoth built around the CPU-GPU-DPU-AI stack. They control three of the four layers, and the Arm acquisition would give them the fourth, and most important layer in the stack. They can build this Goliath licensing Arm technology, but they would be dependent on someone else’s roadmap. That someone else is mostly in the business of selling smartphone SoC IP, and is most interested in the future of IoT.  
>  
>But again, this is precisely what is going to scare Arm’s customers so much. The entire smartphone ecosystem is dependent on the continued development of those cores, and if the company is shifting its attention to the data center, the rest may languish down the road. Those customers may even start looking at RISC-V. They have at least 18 months to mull it over, which is a lifetime in tech.”

**Valuation**

Sure, the stock's expensive at 530, but 3 years out NVDA earns about $24 a share, getting the PE down to 22, which is not bad for a 20% grower.

&#x200B;

I should have expected it but it didn't occur to me until it started happening, but too many people being in the sheet at the same time locked it up to where most people got errors. I was sending out copies of the sheet but with hundreds of DMs it was getting to be too much to keep up with. I'm interested in presenting this in a way that people can access all the want without it locking up, but although I'm an expert with Excel I don't know Python and don't have any experience auto-publishing stuff online. If anyone can help with that let me know!

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, the most common question I got was how I interpret data so I will give examples from today's data below. Keep in mind that none of this is a clear ""buy me!!"" flashing light, it's just how I interpret the data. I've been getting 10% - 15% returns on about 80% of my picks. The indicators convinced me to buy UWMC, ASO, ASRT, RMBL, CVR, SJR, and AMD within the last week. Of all of them the only one I lost money on was RMBL, the rest all sold at a profit.

&#x200B;

So what am I looking at today? Before I go into the criteria, here's what the data has shown my so far. This could change after another few weeks of tracking, but as of right now it says:

1. The social media platform that is the most successful in picking stocks is Reddit
2. Tickers with a Reddit score of 500 or under have been the most likely to go green in the next week
3. The average % return for those categories is 15%
4. The average days until it hits max profit is 6 days

&#x200B;

**All that being said, here's the criteria I look for:**

1. Using Unbias data I copy/paste all the Reddit data for the last 24 hours into my excel sheet
2. From there I filter it down to just items with a score under 500
3. I have a column that calculates the % increase between yesterday and today so I sort it by % return
4. I filter out anything that has already had more than 5% growth. Those aren't necessarily bad buys, I just want the full 15% as often as I can get it
5. I enter each ticker into the Reddit search and manually get rid of anything that isn't a real ticker (sometimes the scraper picks up repeated things that look like tickers but are just phrases)
6. I note any ticker that is being mentioned across at least 4 different subs. I'm looking for stocks that are getting mentioned all over, not just multiple times in 1 sub
7. I filter out anything that looks like it's just bots posting all over the place

&#x200B;

From there I try narrow it down to 3 - 5 that I feel the best about. Keep in mind I'm trading 100% on sentiment, so I don't do any DD on the company itself. My assumption is that if a lot of people are talking about it then they've done all the DD for me, I just have to follow the crowd and jump on the band wagons that are just starting to move. The strategy has worked pretty well, as of today I'm up about 22% since starting this.

&#x200B;

**How do I put it to use?**

1. I spread the money evenly across 3 - 5 of the tickers that just feel the best to me.
2. I hold for no longer than a week. I sell somewhere between 10% and 15%, but if it hits 7 days I sell no matter what. Usually I sell after 5 business days, but sometimes I'll hold a week. If I take a loss I take a loss, but usually I'm up

&#x200B;

So what are my picks today? These are the ones I'm going to look into. I have no idea what will pop and what I'll choose, but these are the ones I'm most curious about based on today's data. I don't know if they're good or not, don't know anything about the companies - only that they fit into the categories that are the most profitable in the spreadsheet

&#x200B;

EDIT: The post was deleted due to mentioning some stocks that it didn't like, [so here's a screenshot of the ones I'll be considering today.](https://imgur.com/gallery/XwhkLWP) Most likely I'm going to throw money evenly across the top 5",['AMD']

m71xi8,,stocks,post,1615992143,"A month of tracking stock scrapers for success/failure rates**TL;DR:** I tracked a couple thousand tickers over the course of a couple months and here's a Google Sheet with the data

**EDIT: Too many people in the sheet are locking it up, so here are some direct links:** 

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)

* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

&#x200B;

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.

&#x200B;

**In the end the two I landed on were:**

[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms

[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data

&#x200B;

**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
   * What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
   * Which social media is the most profitable?
   * What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
   * How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

&#x200B;

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

&#x200B;

**Other interesting finds:**

Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasible

StockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%

**Conclusions:**

Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

&#x200B;

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better.",['GOOGL']

m7f4h7,,stocks,post,1616028265,"Hindenburg Research is about to get taken for a $RIDEI’m so sick of short sellers like Citron and Hindenburg to the point where I’ve decided to load up on shares and calls on Hindenburg’s latest target, Lordstown Motors.

If you haven’t heard of Hindenburg Research, they are a group of 5 dudes who work out of an apartment in NY. They take large short positions in companies and then release research reports to the public to slander them for their own financial gain.

They are primarily known for their hit-piece on Nikola last year – which I think anyone could have called out. Nikola had no factory or means of production for several years.. pretty easy to expose them especially once their stock ran up to $80/share.

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg Attacks Lordstown With Multiple Inaccurate Claims**

Last Friday, Hindenburg went after Lordstown Motors saying they have no “sellable product” and that they are “3-4 years away” from production (according to “former employees”)

Well – Lordstown had an investor call earlier today confirming that production is beginning THIS September (in 6 months), and they also provided [video evidence](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20) that they are currently in the beta phase (think of beta as essentially 97% of the finalized vehicle).

Additionally, Texas-based E-Squared Energy CEO [came to the defense of Lordstown](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/) after the short report explaining that they intend to fill all 14,000 orders over a 2-3 year period. Lordstown is targeting fleet customers initially, so they will be selling a lot of vehicles to service partners like E-Squared Energy (who then sell to actual fleets).

&#x200B;

**Hindenburg was right about Nikola.. Aren’t they probably right about Lordstown too?**

Nope. I live in Ohio near the enormous Lordstown facility, and that parking lot has been packed every day with workers for about 2 years now. I also know first-hand what this company means to the state of Ohio. Lordstown is in the final due diligence phase for the [Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (“ATVM”) loan opportunity](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) – which is a very big deal for any company, especially a start-up. They have over 500 employees and over 200 consultants working there currently. The number of workers will be double by production in September.

Lordstown’s flagship *Endurance* truck will be [shown in action as a proof of concept](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-unveils-truck-for-race-in-mexican-desert/) next month in one of the toughest races ever designed, the San Felipe 250. You can also see numerous other videos of their truck via their YouTube channel.

&#x200B;

**Brief history on Lordstown Motors:**

Lordstown Motors acquired a [6.2 million square foot facility back in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) – this facility now has a replacement value of \~ $3 billion, but they received it for pennies on the dollar due to [GM’s desire to invest](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) in Lordstown. Within their massive production facility, they have carved out an [800,000 square foot area for their propulsion facility](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-prepares-ohio-factory-to-begin-building-betas-next-month) – which will house production lines for advanced battery packs and hub motors.

Lordstown’s CEO, Steve Burns, is an entrepreneur who has always been ahead of his time. Over 15 years ago, he created a startup called MobileVoiceControl—a predecessor to Siri. The technology patents that Burns developed were then sold and [used to help Apple create Siri](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/).

&#x200B;

**Summary of Lordstown’s investor call from 4:30pm EST today:**

1. It was confirmed that production will begin this September – which will make the *Endurance* the first ever *full-size* electric pick-up truck to hit the road. This will allow them first-mover advantage into the massive light duty truck market.

2. The development mule that caught fire a few months ago was a result of human error – this was a human-made prototype, and the Betas that are currently being produced are being welded by robots (Betas are basically 97% of the actual finished product – so these will be a much more accurate depiction of the final vehicle than the development mules were several months ago).

3. In the coming weeks, as betas come off the production line, the vehicles will be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.

4. The fleet vehicle market is unique – which is why pre-order numbers are more based on calculated estimates from service partners like E-Squared Energy (mentioned earlier) and [Holman Enterprises](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-and-holman-enterprises-announce-co-marketing). Holman manages 2 million vehicles including 600K pick-ups. These service partners buy from Lordstown and then sell directly to fleets. It’s important to build relationships early-on with these service partners especially since Lordstown is going to be first-to-market in 6 months.

5. Demand remains very strong amongst service partners, government agencies, and commercial fleets. 

&#x200B;

**This is all great, but how in the world will a company from small-town Ohio scale across the whole country?**

To help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow Lordstown to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays via Camping World’s footprint.

Marcus Lemonis is the CEO of Camping World and a successful businessman and entrepreneur featured on “The Profit.” This man would not enter a long-term strategic partnership with a company unless it was the **real deal**, and I can tell you with 100% confidence that he’s been [all-in on Lordstown](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?lang=en) since last year. I highly recommend visiting Marcus’ twitter and looking through all of the videos and tweets pertaining to Lordstown.

[Joe Burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow) is on board too!

&#x200B;

**Anything else besides their Endurance truck?**

They announced today that they will do a demonstration of their [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) this summer, and it will begin production next year. Their 3rd vehicle will likely be a large SUV.

Keep in mind that as of 2021, the [global light duty vehicles market size is valued at over $600 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/light-duty-vehicles-market) – creating a lot of space for companies like Lordstown to come in and disrupt the industry with their advanced technology and a low price point ($45,000 after federal tax credit).

But given all of that, I think $RIDE’s current *market cap* is currently wayyyy too low especially relative to others in the EV industry. 

&#x200B;

**What is a market cap?**

Market cap—or market capitalization—refers to the total value of all a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares. 

Market cap allows investors to understand the relative size of one company versus another. It effectively measures what a company is worth on the open market, as well as the market's perception of its future prospects.

&#x200B;

**Why are you talking about market cap?**

Because I think it is important to look at Lordstown’s market cap in comparison with two of the other most popular start-up EV truck companies based in the US. *These numbers were from 3pm EST earlier today*:

*Nikola $NKLA - $5.9 billion market cap*

*Canoo $GOEV - $3.9 billion market cap*

**What is Lordstown’s market cap?**

*Lordstown $RIDE - $2.3 billion market cap*

Listen.. I’m just making the point that Lordstown has one of the **biggest factories** in the country and also will be able to produce [**600,000 vehicles annually**](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio) in a couple of years’ time. 

Lordstown is only 6 months away from **mass producing** (not hand-making) the world’s first ever *full size* electric pick-up truck. An *Endurance* will be coming off the production line every 6 minutes in September, and then every 4 minutes beginning in 2022. This is a very big deal, and I think it’s only a matter of time until the stock is accurately-priced especially relative to its peers.

Companies like Nikola, Canoo, and many other EV start-ups are year(s) away from mass production. And I can’t even imagine the 10’s of billions of dollars it will cost those companies to get to market – meanwhile, Lordstown acquired their state-of-the-art facility for [$40 million](https://www.mbtmag.com/home/news/21244850/lordstown-motors-to-finish-first-electric-truck-prototypes-in-march) (and then a couple hundred million in re-tooling the facility). But seriously – this is basically pennies compared to what other EV players like Rivian are paying for their production facilities.

&#x200B;

**Is this just a pump and dump DD post?**

Nope – I’m actually holding mostly January 2023 calls (LEAPS) - meaning that I believe in the long-term growth story here. I have 10 January 2023 call contracts at a $40 strike price. My price target for January 2023 is $150/share, which would mean a market cap of \~ $20 billion. This is a very volatile stock if you look at the 6-month chart, which is why I think holding onto shares or LEAPS is the smartest approach. It is also worth noting that the average price target between the 5 analysts that cover the stock is $30.

Additionally, I hate Hindenburg, and seeing that “report” last Friday set me off. That’s what caused me to do so much research into Lordstown over the past week.

&#x200B;

**Summary:**

To quote Warren Buffett, “You should be greedy when others are fearful”

Hindenburg Research putting out a hit-piece against $RIDE has created some fear for investors. This fear has caused a sell-off and an increasingly high short interest in the stock – I think Hindenburg and the remaining shorts are going to have to cover by the end of this week before they get burned really badly. This company is very real and it is now in the public-eye more than it has ever been.

And to the doubters and bears that will appear in the comments - you’re going to come back and look at this post in about a year when $RIDE is valued about 3-4x of its current price and wish you would have loaded up on these cheap shares ;)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Citron and Hindenburg can go straight to hell. Load the boat on shares of $RIDE – this chart is poised for a breakout. Read my whole post if you want to see why Lordstown is legit and Hindenburg isn’t.

Volkswagen plans to **produce and sell a total of 1 million electric cars (including hybrids) in 2021**. About half of these will be purely electric. Due to the high number of existing production facilities (**VW produces about 10 million vehicles per year**), VW's EV division has been growing about **twice as fast as Tesla since last year**. Volkswagen has several factories in China and the USA where production is currently being switched to mass-produced EV models. The following EVs will be sold by Volkswagen in 2021:

Volkswagen: ID.3, ID4, ID.5, ID.6

Audi: Etron, Etron Q4, Etron GT

Porsche: Taycan, Taycan 2WD, Taycan cross tourismo

Skoda: Enyak

Seat: Cupra El Born

The VW Group also sells several hybrid models. **With a current P/E ratio of 13.6 the share is very favourably valued, the dividend yield is 2.11%.**

Volkswagen is definitely the best EV bet currently available.

VW is already one of the world's biggest auto manufactures.  It is not possible for VW to grow very much more due to this.  I think the auto industry itself is only forecasted to grow about 3%.

If you bid up the price of VW, I believe it can only end in disaster.

This is honestly a foreshadowing of the entire EV dilemma.  It's just not like technology companies in the 90s / early 2000s.

People and businesses already own cars.  They don't really need more cars.  Sure - EV is a great technology and I am glad it is also environmentally friendly.  However, the world is not going from zero cars to a massive market of EV cars.

In the tech boom, the world changed and became more efficient.  Companies went from owning no computers to hundreds of computers and this dramatically improved the efficiency of their business.  And despite all of this, the market still bubbled and crashed.

EV just can not deliver this type of efficiency.  Everyone is still going to own more or less the same amount of cars.  Everyone is still going to commute and be stuck in traffic jams.

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq, S&P 500 futures hit by another jump in Treasury yields

> * Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures fell Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 14-month high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed steep losses Wednesday as Treasury yields came off their highs of the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed market concerns about higher policy interest rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 33,000 level for the first time ever. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high. Dow futures were steady Thursday.

> * While raising its outlook for economic growth and inflation, the Fed cut its unemployment rate forecast to 4.5% this year. The unemployment rate was 6.2% in February. In another hint about the jobs picture, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET, economists expect 700,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down from the prior week’s 712,000 initial jobless claims.

*****

> # 2. Bond traders continue to battle the Fed on rates

> * Despite Fed assurances that near zero rates likely won’t rise through 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield Thursday touched 1.74%, a high back to January 2020, as traders continued to battle central bankers on rates. The rapid climb in the benchmark yield, which started this year under 1%, has been a drag on high growth stocks, many of which are tech stocks on the Nasdaq, as higher rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. In addition to releasing projections Wednesday afternoon after its two-day March meeting, the Fed left rates and its asset purchase program unchanged.

*****

> # 3. Top Biden officials and Chinese diplomats set to meet

> * America’s top diplomat early Thursday pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, hours after reclusive Pyongyang vowed to ignore any U.S. overtures to resume negotiations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the end of security talks with South Korea in Seoul.

> * Blinken will meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington later Thursday. Ties between the world’s two largest economies have been torn for years and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it’s ready or willing to back down from the hardline stance taken under former President Donald Trump.

*****

> # 4. House to vote on two immigration bills, including one for ‘Dreamers’

> * The House was set to vote Thursday on a bill to give so-called Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids, full legal status and a chance for citizenship. A second measure would do the same for immigrant farm workers. Both measures seemed certain to pass. When similar versions of the bills passed the House in 2019, seven Republicans voted for the Dreamers bill and 34 backed the farm workers measure. However, GOP support is expected to plummet this time as the party rallies behind demands for tougher restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

> # 5. Federal April 15 tax-filing day delayed until May 17

> * The federal April 15 tax-filing day has been postponed about a month. Taxpayers can also delay payment of any money owed the IRS until May 17. However, the extended deadline applies only to federal income returns and taxes, meaning that taxpayers will need to check to see if due dates for state taxes have been changed. Not all states follow the same filing schedule as the federal government. Calls to delay Tax Day intensified after passage of the latest Covid relief plan, which tasks the IRS with sending another round of direct payments at the same time it usually processes tax returns and refunds.

Lastly, Opera just recently **hired PayPal & WeChat Pay veteran Allen Hu** as new EVP of the fintech **Dify**.

At about the 100k mark... any comparative feelings towards those in proximity seemed moot (Currently 32, working as a research analyst - but going to do a PhD or second master's soon!)

Guess if there had to be a number associated with the moment growth started to compound visibly - would be around 62k ish.

The initial 8-20k was difficult simply due to wanting to spend it on a car downpayment or something.... I had to learn to ""love"" money and change my field of view, think sunglasses in the movie ""they live"".

Budgeting and going FI was a lot easier in the west with less overt peer pressure- after moving to the Far East with an image based society i've found *everything* and *everyone* is scrutinized. 

You do get better treatment for pulling out a credit card over a debit, and a Rolex over a G shock. Dig a little deeper though and most of the locals are just winging it!",
m7wk1w,,stocks,post,1616089895,"Swing trade on space stocks?If you didn’t know, Cathie Wood has filed an SEC filing for ARKX, her space innovation etf. From my knowledge, there are a few companies that come to mind when I think space - SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket  Labs, Astra, Virgin Galactic. 
HOL, SPCE, VACQ could potentially have an influx of volume in the coming weeks as ARK buys these popular stocks. Overall I’m sure the space sector will be bullish in the future although I’m sceptical that there will be any massive advancements this decade. 

Anyone else thinking along these lines for some of these companies? VACQ and HOL are pretty much at the initial offering price ($10) so seems like very limited downside and big potential reward to me. Personally I’ve got some VACQ, might get into HOL at 12.50",

30% VTI
30% VOO
20% VXUS
20% INDIVIDUALS. (I love investing in penny stocks, but 40% of my green is in big companies. (Mindset: the money in pennies is lost money).

m7kybq,,stocks,post,1616049722,"The Walt Disney Company, a multi-sector play $DISA small write-up on a good swing play for Disney! 

I previously written up on bullish semiconductor stocks, bullish PLUG, and bearish CLOV and have been for the most part correct on those (anyone who followed those plays should have made tendies :\] ). 

For Disney $DIS I see it hitting 200 and maybe as high as 210 in the distant future.

Disney is in a good position for further growth. They are now multi-faceted. You can consider them a **technology** stock with high growth (i.e  DIS+,  HULU), **entertainment** **and** **news** stock (i.e ESPN, Marvel, Star Wars, Disney being the obvious), or even a **reopening** play (i.e their amusement parks, cruiselines, shopping districts).

Their latest earnings report was excellent, but was overshadowed by the nasty drop in tech stocks the last month. Even then, DIS hardly dropped and is reclaiming the 200$ price point.

UBS has a price target of 200$ with the average price targets totaling to 205 according to FinViz.

Catalyst --> DIS to reopen parks in California by April 30. This is huge. The company is only operating from half strength right now in it's online presence of DISNEY+ and other foreign theme parks. I'm from Orange County where the parks are located and there is a strong community of people who will rush to go to the park. Competitor amusement parks such as Knott's berry farm in the area already started hiring thousands of employees in preparation for reopening and Disney will do the same.

Meanwhile DIS has a strong prospect for its streaming purposes. Total subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ were over 140 million in January. Management has forecasted it doubling to 300M+ by 2024. For reference, Netflix has around 200million right now in the 4th quarter of 2020. Prior to DISNEY+, the company has not had a direct connection to its consumers besides the parks, but now it has ""hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide being fed a constant stream of content throughout the year.""

I believe Disney will retest the 200 position and have more to grow from there depending if market conditions have calmed. This is easily a large growth stock going into 2021.

My current positions:  DIS 4/16 200C's","['DIS', 'NFLX', 'TGT']"

Mickey Mouse (Steamboat Willie) will have copyright for eternity and is basically the symbol for the copyright extension. That's good for the company, but bad for the general public.

Every time I think about Disney I think that 'art' has now 120+ years copyright and it will extended to even more soon anyway.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).

&amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards.

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)

&amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still).

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

The new agreement runs through 2033 and will feature two Super Bowls returning to Disney’s ABC network channel.

Amazon is paying about $1 billion per year, according to people familiar with the matter.

ViacomCBS, Fox and Comcast (which owns NBCUniversal) are all paying more than $2 billion per year for their packages, while Disney (which owns ESPN and ABC) will pay around $2.7 billion annually, according to people familiar with the matter. 

It is good to see amazon acquired the exclusive right. This is helpful to improve the amazon prime streaming services and attract more prime members.

Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN stock has decreased by 5% in value as it's currently traded slightly above $9 area.

Although we've expected the gains to be extended furthermore, ZKIN wasn't able to close above key resistance at $10, which led to a correction.

ZKIN is currently correcting, but it seems like the price has bottomed at $8.60 from where the price may uptrend again.

Such correction is a good thing, as if the gains were extended to $11 area, a deeper correction would be seen, possibly scaring off more stock holders.

MACD is currently in a selling wave while the bearish momentum is faltering for a while.

RSI bottomed at 40, found support at key level and haven't led bearish momentum into action.

Overall trend remains an uptrend as the price is located above 50 EMA which is located at $9.07. A break above 20 EMA at $9.27 may resume the strong uptrend again.

m7abg6,,stocks,post,1616014237,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 17, 2021Stocks edged higher, rallying sharply in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) key monetary policy meeting and an upgraded economic outlook by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields rose again, with the 10-year benchmark at 1.646% at the time of writing.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak tomorrow.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

Concerns continue to flare regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Germany, France, Italy, and Spain becoming the latest countries to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination efforts, which were already behind schedule. Studies are currently being conducted in the UK and other places. More information is needed.

It was a solid day today, even with the uncertainty today due to waiting on the fed's decision whether or not to increase the interest rates. Even before their decision, $BB is still holding very well. \~1% in the red for most of the day, and once they released no interest rate hikes we spiked \~4% from today's low. That's awesome.  


ICYMI - Feds are saying there are no interest rate hikes likely through 2023  
SOURCE: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html)  


What does this mean, you ask?   
Interest rates are also known as the ""price of money"". Low interest means borrowing money is cheap, and if borrowing money is cheap you can take out a loan and make more money with that loan, negating the cost of interest you need to pay per month to the bank.  


For the dumb-dumbs: Money easy to borrow. Borrow money from bank and put money into stock market. Borrowed money easy to repay if stock market go up.   


For ultra-dumb dumb: Replace the word ""money"" in the sentence above with ""banana"". Borrowed money make banana into bigger banana.  


What else happened with $BB what the fuck else do you have to say?  
Low volume. Extremely low volume. From [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com), this was the lowest trading day since January 13th. Lowest trading volume in over two months. Why is this relevant?  


We are green on very low volume. Green on low volume means people are accumulating slowly and holding. No/hardly any sellers. I can only assume that this is due to a lot of baggies and that there's a lot of people interested in having this stock hit that sweet $15 strike price this Friday. I'm currently expecting a lot of volatility in the next couple of days due to:  
\-No interest rate hikes  
\-$BB still holding that strong uptrend  
\-Very tight Bollinger Bands on the daily and hourly  
\-RSI on Daily, 4-hour, Hourly are smack dead in the center. This means we are not overbought so we have room to go up, that being said this also means we can go down.  
\-Triple Witching. Read this if you don't know what this is.   [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp)  


With tight Bollinger Bands, the RSI in the middle the stock is able to go either direction in the next couple of days, and triple witching hour happening this Friday, this means $BB COULD, by technical analysis methods, be very violent. Up or down.  


Right now, for those of you that are long and strong like me, do not worry about tomorrow or Friday if $BB goes down. Daily fluctuations do not matter in the long term.  
If $BB spikes, we might see some crazy numbers if it breaks the line at \~14.44.  


Enjoy the rest of your day and I'll catch you guys on my recap of the week on March 19th.  


Take care.",

""(b) Initial Margin

FINRA Rule 4210(b)(4)/02 © 2010 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

For the purpose of effecting new securities transactions and commitments, the customer shall be required to deposit margin in cash and/or securities in the account which shall be at least the greater of:

* (1) the amount specified in Regulation T, or SEA Rules 400 through 406 of the Customer Margin Requirements for Security Futures, or Rules 41.42 through 41.49 under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”); or
* (2) the amount specified in paragraph (c) of this Rule; or
* (3) such greater amount as FINRA may from time to time require for specific securities; or
* (4) equity of at least $2,000 except that cash need not be deposited in excess of the cost of any security purchased (this equity and cost of purchase provision shall not apply to “when distributed” securities in a cash account). The minimum equity requirement for a “pattern day trader” is $25,000 pursuant to paragraph (f)(8)(B)(iv)a. of this Rule.""

&#x200B;

\*\*My doubt:\*\*Help me with the interpretation of the point 4, does it mean that the Initial Margin will be $2,000 if it is greater than the Reg T amount (generally 50%)?

Example: I want to open a long position worth $3,000, will the initial margin be the greater of Reg T 50% ($1,500) and $2,000? It is this the correct interpretation? The greater is $2,000, I would have to deposit $2,000 to cover the Initial Margin and so my account after the purchase will be:

* LMV = $3,000
* DR = $1,000
* Initial Margin = $2,000
* Equity = LMV - DR = $2,000

Or the correct interpretation is that $2,000 is just the MINIMUM EQUITY to mantain in the account? In this case if I wanted to open a long position worth $3,000, the Initial Margin would be the Reg T 50% ($1,500) but I should deposit the $1,500 of the Initial Margin plus $500 in order to mantain the Equity at least equal to $2,000. In this case, after the purchase my account will be:

* Cash = $500
* LMV = $3,000
* DR = $1,500
* Initial Margin = $1,500
* Equity = Cash + LMV - DR = $2,000

Which of these two is the correct interpretation?",['REG']

I’m looking to diversify my portfolio a little and interested in potentially using oil and gas as a place to park some money for the divvies in the near long-term. Does anyone out there have experience in the sector and input on current valuations, risk, and opportunity?

I’m mostly interested because it looks like oil and gas never fully recovered from 2019, and I suspect the major players will continue to grow in a lot of EMs and remain a staple here in the US, but of course they spent a couple weeks going up and now they’re coming back down. Does that represent a buying opportunity?

For example on oil, thoughts on CVX vs BP vs XOM vs RDS? I don’t expect dramatic growth or anything, and I’m aware that the sector can take bruises due to scandals/events and that oil is commonly used as an economic proxy war. I’m interested to hear your thoughts on how that plays out for investors as well.

Yes, oil is phasing out as far as its use to propel vehicles in the future, but the amount of plastics and composites that are derived from Oil are not going away anytime soon. Don’t forget that oil has been steadily at 60+ per barrel.

Also, the natural gas demand will increase as oil fall. Understand that a significant amount of our power is from Nat Gas generators. This will not turn to green energy anytime soon. The technology just isn’t there. 

Lastly, I see Oil and Gas companies transitioning to renewables over time. They have the cash, and we are already seeing a shift in their perspective and priorities. 

As far as picks, I’m in Exxon, Chevron, Energy Transfer, Kinder Morgan, NextEra, Enphase, and Two oil and gas ETFs.

m7qwnw,,stocks,post,1616074432,"""This could be the next TESLA"" and Powerpuff GirlsI've been seeing a lot of posts and comments with something in the lines of ""This could be next TESLA"", and while some are using it as a meme, others are serious and take whats being said pretty serious.

I think one of the origins of this is fomo - fear of missing out, and I understand that, in fact, I think almost everyone understands that. We all have that unrealistic side that still hopes that we gonna hit the jackpot on a stock and get a lot of money. Everyone day-dreams and I think thats good thing, however it also needs to be compartmentalized.

When you join FOMO, with day dreaming and companies like TESLA or Amazon (and in a way GME for a few) that enforce the latter, things can get a bit out of hand.

It is way to easy to get lost and end up both checking stocks that we now think its too late to get in (and oh no we just lost our chance of getting rich) or getting into some stocks that its more gamble than actually DD. And despite writing this post, I have at least one stock that I feel like is gamble and supports my day dream wishes of getting rich, the problem is not on having such stock, but rather build our portfolios based on that.

So when I see posts saying that X Company can be the next Tesla just... chill. Think that through, either if you are writing it or reading it.

In the first case have in mind that a lot of people might read it, people with different backgrounds, knowledge, hopes, dreams and also age. Don't over sell something but rather aim for getting comments like ""I think this has more potential than you are giving to it"". Comments like this means that people actually made some research.

If you are reading... well long-story short... do DD (there are plenty of posts warning about it).

Now the ""Next TESLA"" thing:

A company is many things and many things impact that company. Like Powerpuff Girls sugar ain't enough. What made Powerpuff girls was not only the sugar but also the Chemical X.

Example:

Just because Tesla has had a huge success on EV that does not mean that Seat will have the same success on EV too. Traditional auto brands aiming for EV and changing the their plans for the next years is not the Chemical X but rather the Sugar. I mean, lets be real, it was expected!

Chemical X in Tesla might be Elon itself, might be because it was the first big EV project that succeded, might be because a buch of reasons all together that... well, are unique to Tesla.

That doesn't mean that only Tesla has Chemical X and others don't, but rather don't think it something easy to find or easy to tell.

Not every company will be the next TESLA (most likely 99% of them won't) and for sure something that several companies are investing it also won't be the next Chemical X.

The whole point of this post was just to getting this off my chest and, hopefully, reach to one or two users that really think that everything ""could be the next Tesla"" or believe it when someone says it will. They might be right but... if we were all right all the time... we wouldn't still be here but rather in our own Tesla's in a beach somewhere.

m7e76u,,stocks,post,1616025347,"Now is a great opportunity to go long $TLTAs the title indicates, I believe now is a great time to start building a position in the twenty-year Treasury ETF, ticker $TLT.

This is not a revolutionary idea--probably because I am not a financial advisor, and my thoughts on capital markets should not be misconstrued as investment advice. I am, however, a businessman. As a businessman, I have experience doing business things. It might therefore be pertinent for you all to consider my thesis, for academic purposes at the least.

The last month or two have been, hm, shall I say humorous. Gracefully, I held my tongue as the entire market flipped out about rising treasury yields. Why was I calm amid sharp equity selloffs, rocketing yields, and talk of damaging inflation?

Because a) we've heard this story too many times before, b) not mutually exclusive from a), Jerome kept on trying and trying to tell everyone that rates wouldn't rise for the foreseeable future, and c) this inflation story has not only been bandied about like folklore, but furthermore, all the while, *we've failed to even reach minimum inflation targets*.

Today, we finally heard from our great Teacher, JPow, who reminded the kids that the rules still apply. And what are the rules? Keep printing money and keep rates rock bottom low.

I do not for one moment buy that the unprecedented printing of money, in the face of an unprecedented halt of the entire economy, will cause problematic inflation. Also, in the end, Treasuries are not absolutely tied to the Fed's overnight rate; the demand for Treasuries is what decides the price and therefore yield of said Treasuries. We've just seen one of the biggest selloffs in Treasuries since 2018 (and the very early days of last Feb./March, until the bond ETFs regained sanity and there was a flight to safety). I don't see yields rising more, becoming totally detached from the Fed rate.

For thirty years, bonds have raged bull-wise. I don't see that ending when money is cheap as ever. 

If anything, I see markets settling on cyclical, strong balance sheet equities. Even that, however, is a stretch for me. FANGMAN is about as cheap as it's been in a while. Facebook is ridiculously cheap. Amazon doubled earnings expectations recently and wasn't even rewarded for it. Semiconductors are brimming with demand. Financials are on fire. Airlines and cruises and live events and etc. etc. are preparing to come back with a vengeance. People are buying Bitcoin as if it were gold circa 1849 for Christ's sakes. We're just entering the biotech and clean energy age, even if it's still fledgling and speculative.

Moreover, we've just finished off a HUGE Treasuries selloff. It's not about where we are now, but where we were relative to recently, and with rates still near zero and the economy ready to explode, I simply don't see a reason to seek shelter; bonds will remain strong as a speculative device, as it is in all bull markets. (Bond prices don't rise because your grandma bought you a couple 20-year Bills so you could make $500 dollars when you turned 21. They rise because institutional investors are trading them.) We'd have to see a serious extension of the recent selloff to justify the velocity of Treasury yields--which have already slowed significantly since the latest growth/tech correction. **Oh yeah, and the Fed is still buying Treasuries...Lots and lots of the every day all day from sunrise to sunset and maybe still in the night when no one is looking.** 

For a while now, institutional investors have been short $TLT (lots of put buying as well). Last August, I held the same thesis, didn't have the confidence to follow through, and shed a single tear for each day that passed as a phenomenal opportunity passed me by. Rates had nowhere to go but back up. Especially mortgage rates had gotten out of control. But this is exactly the overextension I was looking for. This is, potentially, an equally profitable opportunity on the upside.

The beauty of this trade is, you can also use this as a mechanism to hold cash for future buying opportunities, keeping it low risk. For example, say you park 10% or so in $TLT. Say it continues dropping for a bit longer. You can sell calls, collect the dividend, and keep your basis down until it turns around again. And if it stays flat, fine, either take the premiums or collect the small interest.

If you're speculating, I think calls are a decent play but not quite yet. Premiums are high as a result of the recent selloff. Personally I think shares are the way to go until IV drops as things stabilize.

I'm going to start building a position slowly as it continues dropping--about 1-2% as a nice foundation, then about .2-.5% every week or two after that. Then, when it begins to flatten out and reverse, start buying more aggressively and discontinue my short call program, until I reach about 10% of my portfolio. I'll then keep it at 10% moving forward, rebalancing when opportunities arise or more cash comes in from the 'ole 9-5.

m7e76u,gravom5,stocks,comment,1616028775,"First, as another poster mentioned, TLT is not 10 years.

Second, while I don't have a crystal ball, you timing on this is likely *horrible*. The likely reason yields have been rising in due to the expiration of the SLR exemption for Tier 1 capital that was but in place last March, combined with the massive influx of cash deposits into the banking system due to stimulus checks. Given that the Fed didn't signal that they were going to extend this exemption or otherwise implement some form of yield curve control, there is a *very*, *VERY* good chance we see yields absolutely skyrocket in the coming weeks.

Again, I don't have a crystal ball, so I'm currently straddling TLT. But doing a long treasuries play right now, without *at least* hedging your position, is just asking to lose all your money.

By the way, I kind of agree with your premise that we wont see rates go much higher but I see lots of holes in your reasons.

Bond yields are not, as you say,  determined by the Fed.  Yields instead are determined by thr market's inflation expectations.  You can see the market is not anticipating inflation in the current negative yields of Tips bonds.

It's mostly opinion and educated speculation (as far as technology).

**TLDR: Agora ($API) was inflated as a proxy stock for Clubhouse. It's not going to be able to compete against what Amazon AWS is offering. Clubhouse growth is on the decline, and Twitter Spaces might be onto something.**

From my last post several weeks ago:

>the app's clunkiness (and what looked to be a poorly-built backend)

In the several weeks since then, it became apparent just how poorly built it was: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56163623](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56163623)

Since these events, which coincided with significant drops in Agora's share price, I commented that they'd struggle to sustain higher than $60. But with other developments in the past several weeks, I wouldn't be shocked to see it fall close to its 2020 IPO price of $25

>**Twitter** has a competing product: Spaces. Announced late November and soft-launched late December, it looks/feels better and has some functionality Clubhouse is sorely lacking,

I've become much more optimistic about Twitter Spaces since then.

# Agora's ~5x price increase since June was probably inflated by Clubhouse hype

I recently commented that $API wouldn't sustain around $60. Now I believe even that was greatly overvaluing the stock. I expect Agora to fall much lower, particularly as it draws more scrutiny. Possibly dipping below its June IPO price.

1. Most of its value is inflated by the hype of Clubhouse
2. Just over a month ago it looked like Clubhouse could reach 20M users by the end of February. Their growth acceleration seems to be declining, and they didn't reach 20M until the weekend, despite there being plenty of invites.
3. **Clubhouse is using competing service PubNub** (which offers similar services) for real time messaging rather than Agora's own RTM service. I'm wondering how this is anything but extremely concerning for Agora since it hints heavily at an upcoming transition from Agora
4. The security concerns of the service as well as the concerns people have had regarding Clubhouse/Agora/China have made it unlikely that Agora will at least be the go-to service for everyone entering the social audio space.
5. **Amazon AWS / Chime SDK.** This [tweet](https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1357319440547856385) and its replies speak for themselves.

**From Wired:**

>*Recent security concerns about Clubhouse run the gamut from vulnerabilities to questions about the app's underlying infrastructure. A little over a week ago, researchers \[...\] found that the app was transmitting \[identifying information\] unencrypted, meaning that a third party could have potentially tracked your actions in the app. \[...\]* ***Clubhouse's infrastructure is run by a Shanghai-based firm \[Agora\]*** ***and it seemed that the app's data was traveling through China at least some of the time***—potentially exposing users to targeted or even widespread *Chinese government surveillance*. Then, on Sunday, *Bloomberg confirmed* *that* ***a third-party website was scraping and compiling audio from Clubhouse discussion***. Early Monday, further revelations followed that Clubhouse discussions were being scraped for an *unaffiliated Android app*, allowing users on that operating system to listen along in real-time.

# Twitter Spaces

1. After seeing Twitter's speed of development, and recent signals that they intend to go directly after Clubhouse with discovery features and a **dedicated Twitter Spaces tab**, I'm incredibly optimistic about Spaces.
2. **This is huge** ***because*** **it's Twitter** — the social network so boring it made headlines for doubling its character limit. This is a major part of something Twitter is going all in on.
3. **Twitter spaces recently released an Android version** — Clubhouse hired a single Android developer *three weeks ago*.
4. Clubhouse has been talking about opening up ""ASAP"" for at least 7 months — **Twitter Spaces is opening up in a few weeks.**
5. Add that to a host of new serious apps aiming to replicate (or rather *do better* *than*) what Clubhouse does (that notably do not use Agora) and the idea that Clubhouse is going to win this game with a few developers seems far-fetched. It may simply be viewed as the Friendster or Myspace of social audio networks.","['TWTR', 'AMZN']"

tl;dr: 23M short shares are available to sell. If those are bought, plus whatever naked shorts they're willing to gamble, then the option chain powder keg gets lit 💥

I'm paraphrasing from those smarter than me (u\\jn\_ku  u\\megahut  u\\freakypheobe)

&#x200B;

RKT is an undervalued behemoth so buy and hold shares in your 401K and you'll be rich sooner rather than later. 

What is interesting for 3/19, however, is that the option chain is a powder keg.  It is so explosive that MM went balls to the wall and just pinned the price so hard at $24.50 that it looked like trading was halted.  They did this after

* the housing report came out bullish, 
* the Fed said no rate hike,
* the Fed said they're going to keep buying MBS, 
* RKT CEO said their competition's anti-competitive behavior backfired and RKT is doing gang busters broker business.

The obvious market manipulation is desperation because there are not enough shares to cover those calls.  There may be 15% to 30% (16M - 30M shares) of free float.

So why $24.50, because any lower and they're negative on the puts, any higher sets off a chain reaction where $25c print, then $27c, then $30c.  We're sitting at Max Pain. Here is the detonation sequence:

* At $25.50, there are 8M shares ITM
* At $29, there are 20M shares ITM  *...there may be only 16M shares in free float*
* At $32, MM may have to buy up ALL of the synthetic shorts to cover the options

If those calls are ITM and naked (I'm thinking they're naked), the option writers will be margin called.  Not *can* be margin called, they *will* be because these are monthly contracts and liquidity can be called on option contracts T+2. That ""T"" is Friday for DTCC and brokers are not holding the bag so they're margin calling as soon as contracts turn red.

So how do we move the price up $1 dollar. One! Solitary! Dollar! to start the lunch sequence?  We have to blow past the sell walls that are floor ceiling shorts.  There are 15M shorts ready to be sold and another 7M that are ready to be borrowed.  If those shares get bought, then it's just naked shorts and price gains while the option writers shit their pants waiting for the phone to ring and being told to put enough cash in their account to pay for every share available.

SCNY was up 50 percent, they are a company that has no real moat. Complete junk stock. They IPOed to pay off the loans from the government.

They do have a new revenue stream of doing a side hustle for AMZN but AMZN is a whipsaw corporation. They use ATI Jet, Atlas/Southern. Whipsaw is lingo for making sure each of their contractors remain competitive, meaning don’t expect any solid revenue growth from SCNY.

Sun Country has no real growth, yes they can grow on the cargo side but nothing that sustains a 50 percent markup on their IPO today.

Last thing I need is for someone to say short it... I can’t, I don’t have the capital to sustain the venture and options will not be available until next week. The market will stay stay irrational longer then I could stay solvent anyways.

Frontier Airlines will also IPO soon, again do not buy that stock at IPO levels, it’s just doing the .com bubble crap. 

However Frontier actually has a lot of room to grow with a good amount of plane orders. They are and were growing at a rapid pace pre-Covid. They have 100+ airplane orders and were hiring a fair amount of pilots. Recently they began hiring again.

TLTR: this is very reminiscent of the dot com bubble. Only thing different is none of these IPOs need a .com.

The new bubble is IPO. Invest smartly don’t FOMO, and beware of junk stocks like SCNY",['AMZN']

m7u9x8,,stocks,post,1616083930,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)MODS: I posted this in /r/investing and thought you all might be interested in the DD.

Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advice. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis.

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically.","['NDAQ', 'SPGI', 'TGT', 'IR']"

m7rcif,grd3hxm,stocks,comment,1616077926,"There is something called a ""round trip"" trade which you can't do more than 3 times in 5 days if you're not a ""pattern day trader"". A round trip is when you open and close a position within the same trading day. A pattern day trader is someone who does this more than 3 times in 5 trading days. The 4th round trip trade will get you a brokerage freeze in some cases. 

However, what you're describing is not a round trip trade. Whether you can do what you're describing depends on whether or not you have a margin account or enough cash for the transaction. If you do, closing a position in a stock or reducing your position and then adding to or re-opening a position is not a round trip, nor is it a good faith violation. If you do not have a margin account, this could potentially be a ""good faith violation"" if you don't have the cash in your account to make the purchase. A good faith violation occurs when you sell a security, and buy another before the cash has settled. Many brokerages will tell you how much cash you have available to make new purchases.

EDIT 3/18: Why am I bullish?  Many of the reasons have already been stated in this [WSB thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6k8kv/plug_power_down_ah_buying_opportunity/).  However I will add in technical jargon the stock looks to be trying to put in a double bottom (a 'W' formation on a stock price chart).  So far anyway, it looks like it successfully tested it's March 5th low.  You might point out it already tried a double bottom and failed just recently and went lower.  I would point out the Nasdaq 100 went into correction territory on March the 5th (a 10% move down).  Many traders/investors look to come in when an index reaches correction territory - I'm hoping enough of these people will come in and take a shine to $PLUG.  But then again I could be wrong and we are headed lower (wouldn't be the first time).

As for the oodles of contempt I'm seeing for Mr. Cramer, I will start by pointing out my experience with him in a comment I made awhile back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvvsc6/jim_cramer_is_out_for_blood/gpfua6j/?context=3).  I admit I may not know all his transgressions and will look over what many of you have to say.

And has confessed many of his despicable hedgie ways.  If he is truly corrupt why has he been so open about some of what he has done?  Could he be someone trying to give away the hedgie playbook?  Hey, like I say right now I'm hooked up to the Pollyana side of my brain.

GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.

The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.

XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”

Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.

“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”

XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.

The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.

XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

anyways YI released their 4Q and anuual, which seems to have fantastic results, but i was doubting  a bit cause i wasnt familair with the company, i read a bit, and the results of growth in revenue (96.1%) and gross profit told me i got to get in, even tho its slightly lower tha nthe previous one, but how can u stick to 100%, and by reading about the expected revenue, i saw they beat the expactaion.

&#x200B;

so it was 18.06 at the pre market. i read the the report once it went out. and after a lot of times i was too cheap to get in because of 5-7% up in pre, i lost alot of ""winning trades"" - so this time i decided to get in whatever, if its not to high, so it got my order in lmt of 19.3 (ofc it got me in 19.3 and not 18.95 which was the previous jump) - but right away it jumped , to 20- after that it reached even to 20.5 which was 13.21$ already in pre. 

 i thought to my self that maybe its true and its a good report, but then it started to bounce back, while i still cant see any comment or anything about the report - i had my doubs maybe to get out, but i said to my self lets wait to the openning to make those decisions, probably just lack of volume ( which got me in the first place as a mistake, i think im dont with the pre from now on) 

any way its kept the down trend, i still made a lot of mistakes which i'll not get in detail in here for my sake, but they were just the worst, and from 13.21% in the pre to 8.25% now and still going - im still in, didnt cut looses, idk, i just dont know.

is it the market today, maybe, but its not just that, it seem the sell of related to the report too.

ill be glad if someone can look at  the report and the other company reoports and tell me what's the reason for that sell of, what have i missed, and should i stick a bit in the stock and it might go a bit higher?

m7roqc,,stocks,post,1616076766,"The intrinsic value of stocks, pt 1Hi guys,

I wanted to say thanks to u/shortyafter for [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7ppir/really_surprised_by_all_the_misinformation_on_here/), were he was talking about how it's wrong to say that stocks have 'no intrinsic value and it's totally abstract and a popularity contest'; but then what is their intrinsic value and how do we decide their value?

Let's start with clarifying what is a share: we can define a share as a small piece of the company, if you own a share, that means you are a co-owner of the company.

So if you want to know what should be the price of a share you have to apply the formula:

price of a share=  market cap/number of share

The number of shares is a public information, but what about the market cap?

The market cap is usually calculated based using the Net Cash Flow of the company, that once again is a public information available in the Financial Statements, the interest rate i, and the growth of the NCF g:

Market Cap= NCF/(i-g)

Now this is really the basic, and sorry if I missed something or used the wrong terms (I did not study this in English), this was just to give an idea that no matter what the market thinks and how popular is a company, if a company is able to produce a positive Cash Flow, it will always have an intrinsic value in the long term.

m7ac50,,stocks,post,1616014291,"Basic DD on Nano Dimensions and why it has major long term potentialHello everyone, 

I’m a 24 year old student who started investing a few months ago and would like to talk a bit about Nano Dimensions. 
The sources for the information below has been taken from Yahoo Finance, Interviews with the CEO, Videos that the company has made, other DD’s that had info I found to be usefull. Hope y’all like it. 

**What does Nano Dimensions do?**

First off. They sell 3D printers that can print all kinds of complex electric components like circuit boards, capacitators, antennes, sensors and SEMI CONDUCTURS.  Which Biden signed the executive order for because of the shortage of those at the end of last month. The CEO has a good track record. This ain’t his first Rodeo. Been involved in Aerospace, Security etc. Eli David is on the Board of Directors.


**Now why would anyone buy those printers?
Well a bunch of reasons.**

1. No outsourcing of production which saves them money. 

2. Increases confidentiality cause customers build their own IP. (E.g: Important for Defense/Medical)

3. Time saving since customers are able to get their prototypes within hours instead of days-weeks. 

4. Eco Friendly cause less waste compared to current manufacturing process

5. Automated printer = less operator maintenace

6. Able to be used 24/7

7. Their machines are just so much more efficient. E.g; The more layers a circuit board has, the more complex the manufacturing is right? Not for these printers. Nano Dimension's printers can print up to 30 layers at the same cost and ease as one with 2 layers. 

8. Will become able to be used in space. Whole lot cheaper to have some electronic component manufactured right there instead of having to send something into space. *CEO said that they will test the materials in Space and plan to manufacture Products for the use in Space. But for now they don't play to produce in space, that would contradict their plans for the automatic factory.*


**Financials:**

They did a bunch of offerings. Any shareholder might know that it’s been a bumpy ride. But it’s been worth it. 
Currently they’re sitting at little below $1.5 Billion cash and zero debt.
Market cap: $2.81B

**Revenue:**

2019 4thQ: $1.977.000

2020 3rdQ: $438.000

2020 4th Q: $1.971.000


This is a $6k YoY decrease from their 2019 4thQ Revenue. 
Now why isn’t this really that bad of a signal? Most of their revenue comes from selling these printers. These go for hundreds of thousands. Due to covid a lot of entities decided to hold off on capital expenses causing a major dip in revenue. But even tho covid is for the most part still around; we have seen a major spike compared to the previous quarter as capital expenses have started to open up for some of them. They were expected to have a lot less revenue and managed to hold pretty strong under the current circumstances.

**What about competition?**
Well tbh. Atm there ain’t no competition. Literally no one. These guys secured the patents. If this pops off they taking it all. 

**So where's the money coming from?**
They sell to Defense, Research Institutions, Automotive, Medical, fucking everywhere. I mean its electrical products they're making. What industry doesn’t use them? 

**Revenue streams:**

**1. Printer Sales**
As I said, these machines go for hundreds of thousands.  70% of customers renews their machine every time a new one comes out. They like the tech. So big chance that any new customer will buy more than 1 printer. Which ofc. also means years of recurring revenue and maintenance contracts.

**2. Recurring Revenue**
The blades and material need to be replaced.

**3. Nanoservices**
This is an interesting one. Last year they barely sold machines since companies atm lack the budget for these printers. However revenue was better than expected since customers who are currently lacking the budget come and pay for Nano Dimensions to print their project for them. Can be anywhere from $5-20k per project. 
The thing thats good here is, its a great opportunity for them to build a relationship with their customers and make them more familiar with the tech. CEO expects many of these customers to start buying the machines when their budgets open up post covid, causing a sling shot effect in sales. 

**4. Maintenance contracts**
Speaks for itself

So where is their potential growth? 

1.	They will release a new printer this year. *New Printer-Generation will be announced early summer, shipping will be possible eoy*
2.	They are still looking for more new types of electrical components to manufacture. *They are looking into nano-mechanical devices as well*
3. They are looking for acquisitions in 2 types of companies. I'll explain more on that below
4.	They are planning on making printers that will be able to be used for production instead of prototyping/testing. Some defense companies already use this as production because the projects they require aren’t possible to manufacture without these printers.
Now I don’t think I gotta explain why that’s a good thing.
Once their machines are able to be used for production that will open a completely new door to them  I believe 2022 is what the CEO said IIRC. 

**Acquisitions**

Now this $1.5B is gonna come in handy. It will be shares and cash for these acquisitions tho.  However the CEO refuses to enter the “rat race” where private companies have become overvalued and is taking his time to decide, refusing to overpay. Says he is in talks with multiple companies atm. 

Now the 2 types of companies they are looking to acquire are:

**Type A**: Companies that can help them with distribution and are working in the pcb industry. Market cap of $50-200M. 

**Type B**: Companies that have tech that they want to own and/or think is going to be big in 2-3 years.

Note: *One of the european ones will be a producer of machines, prop. central or eastern europe, to help them reducing their time to market for Dragonfly NG*

**Risks**

There is always a chance of them doing more offerings, although I don’t see that happening personally. *CEO made clear that they did not plan it in the near future.*
This is right now a niche market but with years will become huge imo. If you want something to daytrade this stock might not be it for you. It can be very volatile so if that’s not your thing stay away too. Also if they don’t spend this $1.5B wisely, investors may lose trust after having shares diluted a bunch of times. Personally I trust the CEO because of his track record with acquiring companies and taking his time, refusing to overpay for companies. 


That’s all I’ve got. 
Would like to hear some feedback. Anyone else invest in Nano Dimensions? What’s ya’ll opinions on the company and the future share price? Good investment or waste of time?

And coincidentally many of these stocks are already your classic meme stocks technically overvalued.

I have been tracking roughly 400 tickers that have appeared on 48 hour and weekly sentiment lists and it's performance is inferior relative to index funds over that period. Of course there are some winners but I've yet to have any top 10 or 20 list for a period outperform an index. 

Are we sure this sentiment scraping stuff isnt just playing into the exact data shorty wants? You get replies in the comments like ""this is genius!"" and ""I'm going to make so much money"" and check the acct and it's often less than a month old only active in stock subs with a couple comments. 

Be careful folks. The sentiment data may identify stocks worthy of further DD, but the amount of euphoric responses to daily sentiment scraping posts worries me we have a lot of short research occurring on here disguised as help.",

m7dhpq,,stocks,post,1616023097,"Just increased my positions in Big Tobacco.Update post here.  This one will be short and less data-driven.  If you want the original, detailed DD with numbers and facts, check out my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loygiq/why_i_just_went_long_on_big_tobacco/).

**Rationale**

I bought into Big Tobacco a month ago because I saw a safe mid-to-long term investment there.  People have been saying tobacco is on the way out for decades, and yet here we are.  Smoking is decreasing and becoming more regulated in the first world, but it's actually increasing quite rapidly in emerging markets.  I don't see it going away in at least the next 30-40 years, and there's been data to support that.  Again, check my original post if you're interested in that data.

I've invested modestly in a retirement fund IRA over the past few years, but this February marked my first foray into a more personalized and perhaps even ""aggressive"" investment approach.  I had a lot of cash on hand and while there's certainly an argument to be made for dollar cost averaging, I was kind of eager to start investing and decided to pull the trigger on some sizable (for me) investments.

I saw that a lot of the market seemed to be, IMO, overheated.  Will the bull run continue?  Maybe.  I don't know.  But with the P/E ratio the S+P 500 is trading at right now, I do reckon I'm a bit late to it.  So I didn't want to dump too much into tech or growth stocks... too risky at this point.  Especially for me because I'm not sitting on huge amounts of cash.  I did put some in MSFT and AAPL, and also BABA.

The largest portion of my portfolio, however, was and is in Big Tobacco.  I've got the 5 biggest tobacco companies (MO, BTI, PM, JAPAY, IMBBY), as well as the largest grower (UVV) and two accessories / smokeless brands (SWMAY and TPB).  I like some more than others but decided to diversify in everything in order to hedge against any total losers.

Last night I decided to paper hands BABA for a minor loss because I don't think I was fully aware of the risks involved with China when I bought in.  Still an amazing company and possibly worth the risk, but I'm somewhat risk averse so it just doesn't make sense for me at the moment.  I used the proceeds from that sale to increase my positions in Big Tobacco.

&#x200B;

**Updates on my positions:**

**Cigarette companies:**

Altria (MO) is my #1 tobacco position by just a tad.  I like the way they're positioning for cannabis and legalization in the US, something that I missed in my original DD.  They also seem to be trading well with a lot of possibility for growth.  Did not YOLO into them because they only serve the US market, where cigarette consumption is declining.

British American Tobacco (BTI) #2.  I love their exposure to emerging markets, and since my last DD they have announced a 20% stake in a Canadian cannabis company (OrganiGram). I upped my position significantly in the last couple of days.

Phillip Morris International (PM) #3 just a tad under BTI. Again, I love their exposure to emerging markets and brand portfolio. These guys sell Marlboro around the world.  Not my #1 position because they trade pretty high at the moment, but still up there for me.

Japan Tobacco International (JAPAY) #4.  Significantly lower stake than the first 3.  I'm still kind of a noob so I do rely on third-party analysis of companies to some extent, and I haven't been able to find much for them.  What I gather is that they had a poor performance last year, and also projected poor performance for 2021.  That said, they have a huge portion of the market share in Asia, where smoking rates are going up significantly.  Worth a small stake IMO.

Imperial Brands (IMBBY) #5. Similar stake to JAPAY.  These guys are the smallest of the bunch and a bit of a laggard.  They've been trading south for a long time and their last year was lackluster.   Innovation is also questionable.  That said, they are a huge international tobacco company, and I reckon they'll be here to stay and paying dividends for quite some time.  Worth a small stake.

**Other positions**

Universal Corp. (UVV) - Stake that's in between my top 3 and my lower 2 cigarette companies.  Largest grower of leaf tobacco in the world, and they sell to all 5 of the companies above.  Great dividend payout.  Trades fairly.  Didn't want to YOLO into them because there's little room for innovation here at the moment, but it's a solid business for the time being.

Turning Point Brands (TPB) - Similar position, and new since my last DD.  They sell Zig-Zag rolling papers in the US, smokeless tobacco, and also CBD products.  Steady revenue from what they already sell, and huge upside potential on cannabis legalization.  They have data that shows that all of their smoking papers sell markedly higher in legalized states, plus the potential for CBD and

Swedish Match (SWMAY) - Similar position, and new since my last DD.  They sell Zin, a nicotine pouch (tobacco-free) product that is dominating the US and Scandinavian markets at the moment.  Product shipments have increased markedly over the last 4-5 years with no signs of slowing down.  Oh, they sell those White Owl blunt wraps too, as well as Red Man Chew.  So steady revenue there, as chewing tobacco declines but White Owl sales rise.  Did not want to YOLO into it because I'm not sure about the future of nicotine pouches, but worth a small stake for the time being.

&#x200B;

**The Bottom Line**

I don't like the uncertainty of the market right now, and I feel I was a bit late to the game on many of the growth stocks.  I don't own purely tobacco, I also own the tech stocks I mentioned above plus some others in other sectors (feel free to ask).  But my largest position is by far in tobacco.  Like I said,  I think these are a safe bet medium-to-long term no matter what happens, with great dividends and huge potential growth opportunities in cannabis and other smoking alternatives.

Safer than throwing it all in an S+P 500 index fund, even if I won't get the same returns in the event that stonks always go up.  Lose some of the potential upside, but also lose a lot of the potential downside.  Fits my needs perfectly.

Moral questions: I'm a noob, small-time retail investor.  I don't think I'm killing anybody by investing small amounts of money in these companies.  And I don't feel bad making small amounts of money off of them.  I used to smoke and I like these stocks because that stuff is really addictive.  7 years off of it thankfully.

My dividends, for now, are all set to reinvest.

m7dhpq,grbi90m,stocks,comment,1616041358,"Great DD. I think the play for Big Tobacco isn't necessarily tobacco but cannabis. Both Altria and BTI are getting heavily in invested in the cannabis market with weed growers, weed tech companies, vaping tech, and the like. Big Tobacco already has the distribution networks, lobbying capability, capacity to grow, and access to banking that many of the pure weed companies lack. Couple that with the fact that tobacco companies have been planning for decades how they'd roll out legal cannabis products. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for them to pivot away from evil tobacco and onto ""healthy, cool, dank"" weed. 

&nbsp;

TLDR: I'm hella bullish on MO and BTI and am preparing my rocket to tendie town for when Congress passes national legalization. I will see you there.

m7ic7i,,stocks,post,1616039124,"How does Ray Dalio's All Weather Portfolio reconcile with his latest views on Bonds?First of all, apologies if this is not the appropriate subreddit for this as this is not strictly related to individual stocks. I don't think I'm breaking any rules but I'm relatively new here so would appreciate any guidance.

With that out of the way, I wanted to get the hive mind's thoughts on Ray Dalio's All Weather Portfolio. For those not aware, the portfolio comprises of 40% long term bonds, 15% intermediate bonds, 30% stocks, 7.5% gold and 7.5% commodities. The idea is that it is 'all-weather' and can help preserve and grow your portfolio regardless of the economic cycle. You're of course not going to make the same returns as a 100% total stocks portfolio in a bull market, but the goals here is to grow your assets with least volatility.

This strategy is well established, well espoused and is rigorously back-tested. However, there have been recent posts from Bridgewater indicating there's no point in holding bonds. E.g. - [https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/why-in-the-world-would-you-own-bonds-when](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/why-in-the-world-would-you-own-bonds-when)

Ray Dalio himself has come on CNBC and claimed that it's pointless holding bonds - I can't find an exactly link right now for his interview. This has me really confused. Given the all weather portfolio is 55% bonds, and Dalio and Bridgewater are now claiming that bonds are useless, then what goes into the All Weather portfolio in their place? 

I've invested quite a bit of money per this strategy and the recent bonds sell off coupled with the above statements have me concerned. I'm hoping someone smarter than me that has looked into this can help enlighten me!",

m7ic7i,grbzkat,stocks,comment,1616056311,"First, the All Weather fund is passively managed, so they won’t change the allocations just because Dalio thinks bonds are going to go down soon.

Second, the All Weather Fund is far more complicated than a fixed % allocation. They use a strategy called risk parity which makes extensive use of leverage. This involves using leverage to buy bonds. The fund also has an inflation adjusted bonds component (TIPS, presumably).

There are publicly available funds that try to replicate the All Weather strategy, but when I looked at them their performance was poor. And no, nobody here is replicating that strategy. Trying to replicate it involves leverage: Wealthfront uses [total return swaps](https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/risk-parity/), futures are perhaps another way to do it. Options or simply borrowing on margin are going to be too expensive.

If you just try to match the stated asset allocation %'s without leverage, you will drastically underperform the All Weather Fund.",

The real reason I say TM as a buy is because they are going to be an adversary to Tesla by making cheap, reliable, and driver-friendly EV’s. 

The market this year has pumped electronic vehicle start ups 300-1500%. People are looking for the next Tesla, and for the for seeable future I don’t think there is going to be one.

U/Breezytrigga1

Investing in Palantir now could be life changing  money in 3 years (I am holding 10) . Here is my take and why 80% of my portfolio is in this: 

1) Exposure to Military and Defence sector: Government contracting had early extension- Government money was PLTR’s main source of income for years. Biden was part of OBAMA party and he was high on war and tech. History will repeat itself and they will always be number 1 in government support. “CEO mentioned importance of this himself goes both ways” 

2) Monopoly &amp; Patents/ Ai: 
The Technology they use is so complex IBM could not compete for years and later became a client. No one is able to offer their services similar. There is 0 competition and if anyone wants to compete with their data science it will take a long time to complete. 

3) NEW Contracts/Clients(Commercial): 
They had massive contract signings as they move into Commercial sector which they have never done. Helping big names and look into how many country’s they are in. Mostly US. That is changing fast with new contracts in Japan, and UK. Also, this is the 1st time they had a Sales team to get new clients and introduce what they can bring to the table. Their new contracts were not shown in Q1 report and reason the stock fell+ lock up period over. Q2 and Q3 will reflect all the new money. 

4) FED statement “Powell” Today: 
Powell said very specifically interest rates are not going up. For Growth companies and Giants this is the time to scale and take advantage with good leadership. 
He also said “Late cycle behaviour says companies absorb higher labour cost in their margin” what does this mean? 
Basically saying companies (Ex: Amazon) will take the hit on margin for employment on their net profits- without lowering wages to stay more competitive because there is lots of competition. 
This tells me that big business is going to eat up the small guys because they’ll have a hard time growing with smaller margins because they don’t pump the same volume. 
Which Company Benefits from everything? 
Palantir: not only is it a monopoly and the biggest fish in its pond. 
It is the best thing to help the big fish in every other sector have the edge it needs to dominate.  The small fish can’t access it because they can’t afford it. 
Imagine trying to run a business against your competitors without using Google in any way shape or form. This is the best comparison on a larger corporate ladder to show how impactful it is as a resource.

m6zj3s,gr8f5hr,stocks,comment,1615986959,"Interest rates matter, and if they rise high enough there are a few theoretical issues.

1. Bonds become more attractive as an investment because they are a safe way to get a guaranteed return if the yield is high enough. No one wants bonds right now because the yields are abysmal, but if they went up enough people might reconsider.
2. Companies, (speculative growth companies in particular), have had access to basically free debt with interest rates so low which has inflated their values. If they can no longer access free money, they start to look like riskier stocks and people will rotate to safer havens.
3. There are concerns with inflation, and one of the tools to combat inflation is to raise rates. If inflation ends up being bad enough, the Fed may be forced to raise rates to combat it. This could have cascading effects, and typically you would only want to raise rates if the economy is strong enough to handle it. Given the COVID situation, it is unlikely that the economy is all that strong right now (though it might be).

On top of this, there is just a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now. It is unclear how reopening is going to play out and the market rallied to all time highs through a pandemic. It is reasonable to wonder what the next couple of months hold. We may see the economy rip back to life, we may see the effects of trillions in stimulus causing inflation, we may pay for the effects of COVID economically from kicking the can down the road last year. Given all this uncertainty, it is reasonable to see skittishness from rising yield rates as it is hard to say how things are going to play out.",

Yeah I know there are so many articles and news on the AAPL Car (“Project Titan”) and I guess most of them are rather wrong than true. If you didn’t follow the latest news, maybe this article on appleinsider.com will bring you up to date: [Apple Car | Release Dates, Features, Specs, Rumors (appleinsider.com)](https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-car) . 

But let’s say ok, there is a chance an Apple Car is already in planning or contracts already are signed.  According to appleinsider and also some German newspapers BMW is one of the possible partners for such a project. However, they already have some partnerships as BMW already support Apple CarKey and CarPlay. 

Reading that Apple will invest over 1 billion euros in Germany and plans European Silicon Design Center in Munich for me was like “bang”, as just a few month ago BMW released that they will invest 1 billion euros in an innovation think tank in Munich.

Morgan Stanley is the first big U.S. bank to offer its wealth management clients access to bitcoin funds, CNBC has learned exclusively.

The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The move, a significant step for the acceptance of bitcoin as an asset class, was made by Morgan Stanley after clients demanded exposure to the cryptocurrency, said the people, who declined to be identified sharing details about the bank’s internal communications. Bitcoin’s rally in the past year has put Wall Street firms under pressure to consider getting involved in the nascent asset class.

But, at least for now, the bank is only allowing its wealthier clients access to the volatile asset: The bank considers it suitable for people with “an aggressive risk tolerance” who have at least $2 million in assets held by the firm.

Two of the funds on offer are from Galaxy Digital, a crypto firm founded by Mike Novogratz, while the third is a joint effort from asset manager FS Investments and bitcoin company NYDIG.",['MS']

Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.","['PYPL', 'AMZN', 'EBAY', 'ETSY']"

It's a sinking ship currently, and they need a really big idea to plug a lot of holes. 

eBay did well with auction style format, that dopamine rush you get from bidding. Then they enticed large sellers like buy.com and offshore generic sellers to list millions of Buy it Now listings and flood the site but they didn't have the resources to compete with Amazon's growth into that space. All the while alienating their customer base of indiviual sellers and auction buyers. Nowadays buyers have high expecations of getting their product instantly, so waiting 7 days to wait and see if you ""win"" an auction is not in the cards. 

So Amazon will continue to crush them with their stronger backend of analytics, and those auction sellers will turn to Facebook Marketplace since there are no fees. Amazon's fees are high, but as a seller they have far more backend to help you sell.","['AMZN', 'EBAY', 'FB']"

m7tf09,,investing,post,1616081643,"XPO Logistics moves closer to spin-off with new name, SEC filingXPO disclosed in December that it was spinning off a pair of companies. GXO, which had been provisionally named NewCo, will be the second-largest contract logistics provider in the world. Usage of the new company name, logo and other brand components will become effective upon the completion of the spin-off, expected to take place in the second half of the year.
The other spin-off, provisionally called XPORemainCo, will be a global provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truck brokerage transportation services.
XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs said GXO’s letters “stand for the game-changing opportunities we’re bringing to the table for customers, employees and shareholders, with a nod to our XPO heritage. GXO will take this legacy into the future as an independent public company, with countless ways to deliver logistics at full potential.”
Jacobs said that thanks to years of investment in technology as part of XPO, GXO will be well positioned to capitalize on the logistics industry’s predominant secular tailwinds: The growth in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, fast-growing customer demand for automation and digital capabilities and a shift toward outsourcing supply chain services.
“The new company’s brand identity captures the qualities that make us an industry leader – our ability to deliver faster, leaner, smarter logistics for customers at lower cost, using advanced automation and data science,” said Malcolm Wilson, XPO’s chief executive officer  – Europe, who in January was named to become CEO of GXO. “I’m looking forward to leading our global team to the many new opportunities in our future.”
XPO has filed a confidential initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned spinoff of its logistics business.
The transaction is subject to various conditions, including the effectiveness of the Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the refinancing of XPO’s debt on terms satisfactory to the XPO board of directors, and final approval by the XPO board of directors.
XPO has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as its financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal adviser to assist with the spinoff process.

m7ih59,,investing,post,1616039606,"The Current State of Uranium. A Move In Spot Price Could Be SoonGenerally speaking, I am looking at uranium as a macro investment based on the supply and demand dynamics of the market. At a high level, uranium needs to be in the $50+ (some say $60+) range in order to cover the cost of production. Right now the spot price is hovering around $30.   

That being said, uranium is outperforming. So what then is driving this run? Are we likely to see a move in spot soon?

Personally, I think that the equities are ahead of themselves a little bit and that we could be seeing a pull back soon. I hope not. Still, the spot price is a little bit of a question mark for me because I have seen a number of interviews saying that we are very close for a move in the uranium price. This has led me to the view that I should hold my positions and slowly build until the spot price starts to move.  It’s a risk, but my hypothesis is that the real move will far outpace where we are today.  

Ultimately, uranium is about climate change more than anything and so I am glad we are ahead of schedule. Nuclear is the only way to achieve the carbon goals. 

I will be watching closely in the next few weeks for any movement in the uranium price. Should the spot rise as many of us expect, uranium stock prices will soar.

As always. I am interested in how others perceive the current landscape. Any and all feedback is appreciated.",

Since this post, numerous people have messaged me with more information around FTFT. I personally found it very insightful and thought this community would as well. I've looked deeper into those comments and this is what I've found.

This is not financial advice.

---

If you don't know who FTFT is -- fruit company turned blockchain technologist -- please go to my previous post and read up. This DD will assume that you have a basic understanding of FTFT by now. I believe that FTFT is a grenade with the pin pulled and its investors are about to blow up. I will break down this DD into 2 main arguments:

- FTFT plans on liquidating its shares

- FTFT is financially unstable

- FTFT shows signs of fraudulence

---

**FTFT plans on liquidating its shares leaving us the bagholders**
---

What do I mean by this? I mean they are trying their damndest to convert common stock to USD and leave all their investors as bagholders.

Already, we know that FTFT is spending money like crazy except they are using common share stock as their currency. Basically, they are dumping as many of their shares as possible:

- Purchase of Sichuan Ticode Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-a-definitive-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-sichuan-ticode-supply-chain-management-co-ltd-301236975.html))

> The 60% equity interest of Ticode was valued at approximately $66.45 million which will be paid for in 7,789,882 shares of FTFT common stock priced at $8.53 per share

- Purchase of Asiasens Investment Holding Pte. Ltd. ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-enters-into-indonesia-market-and-signs-share-exchange-agreement-to-acquire-asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd-301195800.html))

> Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited is acquiring 70.59% of the equity interest of Asiasens by using 2,160,000 shares of common stock

- Purchase of Spondula ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-and-spondula-signed-term-sheet-for-potential-acquisition-301135582.html))

> According to Term Sheet, the acquisition price is expected to be $3.06 million and the consideration will be paid in FTFT's common stock

The list goes on. If they could, they'd buy their coffee using common shares.

They also enjoy diluting their shares through direct offerings for USD:

- 2/11/21: 2 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-11-9-million-registered-direct-offering-301227178.html))

- 1/14/21: 3 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-15-million-registered-direct-offering-301208607.html))

- 12/24/20: 4 million share dilution in direct offering ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/future-fintech-group-inc-announces-the-closing-of-8-million-registered-direct-offering-301199246.html))

And the most frightening one...

- **2/26/21: 240 million share dilution** ([source](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html)): this one has not gone into effect yet, but if FTFT chooses to exercise this, it would increase the current outstanding shares of 60 mil by 5x and slash everyone's share prices to a fifth of what it once was. AND, this was all done without a single shareholder vote. As per the SEC filing:

> As permitted by Florida Law, on February 12, 2021, we received a written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders from holders of 31,394,260 shares of Common Stock representing 52.73% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock approving the Amendment (the “Consent Action”).

Of this 53% representation, half of it represents the CEO of FTFT and his son who collectively own over 25% of the voting shares. Another 10+% is owned by individuals and I can't find where the other 20% comes from.

This share dilution would be the nuclear option for shareholders and there's a date associated with it:

> Pursuant to Rule 14c-2 promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Amendment and Share Increase will not be effective until at least twenty (20) days after the date on which this Information Statement is filed with the Commission and a copy hereof has been mailed to each of our shareholders. The Company anticipates that this Information Statement will be mailed or furnished to our shareholders on or about February 26, 2021.  Therefore, the Company anticipates that the Amendment and Share Increase will be effective on or about **March 18, 2021**, or such later date as all conditions and requirements to effectuate the Amendment and Share Increase are satisfied.

Any date after March 18, 2021, FTFT may exercise this option and completely destroy their current investors. Maybe they do it, maybe they don't. But they can whenever they want.

---

**FTFT is financially unstable**
---

First off, isn't is strange that they are acquiring companies without any hard currency? What's probably stranger is all the law suits they are involved in for failing to make payments for leases, contracts, and loans ([source for all referenced lawsuits](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006)).

- Beijing Bank ($4.36 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) did not repay the loan on time and Beijing Bank filed an enforcement request with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in June 2017.

- Ningxia Bank ($3.63 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loan and Ningxia Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate people’s court in August 2017.

- China Construction Bank ($2.13 Million)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) has not repaid the loans and China Construction Bank filed an enforcement action with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court in March 2017.

- China Cinda Asset Management ($5.8 million)

> In April 2015, China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. Shaanxi Branch (“Cinda Shaanxi Branch”) filed two enforcement proceedings with Xi’an Intermediate People’s Court (the “Court”) against SkyPeople China for alleged defaults pursuant to guarantees by SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to its suppliers for a total amount of RMB 39.60 million or approximately $5.8 million.

But what about more recently (the list goes on and on btw, I'm just not including everything)? Funny enough, the lawsuits still stack up except now instead of USD or RMB (Chinese currency), now its in shares as well!

- Luwei ($3 million in shares)

> On April, 11, 2019, Xi’an Arbitration Commission made its decision and ordered SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) to repay RMB 3 million investment to Luwei. Mr. Luwei applied with Intermediate Court of Xi’an (the “Court”) for enforcement of the arbitration award which process was terminated by the Court due to no assets for enforcement. As of December 31, 2019, SkyPeople China has not repaid the amount.

- Shaanxi Overseas Investment Development Corp. ($1 million in shares)

> SkyPeople China (old name of FTFT) failed to make the interests payment and Shaanxi Overseas Investment filed the lawsuit for breach of agreement. On December 26, 2019, Yanta District Court of Xi’an City (the “Court”) ordered SkyPeople China to pay Shaanxi Overseas Investment the preferred share redemption amount of RMB 5 million plus penalty which is calculated based upon the RMB 5 million at a rate of 24% a year.

- Shaanxi Wanyuan Construction Co., Ltd. ($8.5 million)

> In July, 2019, the Baoji Court ordered Guoweimei (subsidiary of FTFT) to pay construction and decoration costs of RMB55.07 million to Wanyuan, plus interest. As of December 31, 2019, Guoweimei has not repaid the amount.

**Worse yet, FTFT even admits that their financial instability in September of 2020** ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm)):

> The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.

**FTFT shows signs of fraudulence**
---

Already, FTFT has been indicted for fraud by the SEC in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1000%** ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)).

In just the past 2 years, FTFT has hired and dismissed over 3 independent auditors (very strange behavior for a company) ([source](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf)). It's even stranger when you realize that these independence accountants really only work for a few months on average before being dismissed.

- Yu, lasted 3 months

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Yu Certified Public Accountant P.C. (“Yu”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee dismissed Yu as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Wang lasted 7 months

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee also approved Wang to act as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

> On January 9, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Company dismissed Wang as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, effective immediately.

- Simon & Edward LLP lasted 1 month

> On March 21, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.

> On April 26, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed Simon & Edward, LLP (“Simon & Edward”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

- BF Borgers, the current accountant (we'll see how long they last)

> On April 3, 2020, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of BF Borgers as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm

Now who is BF Borgers? Well, let's look at their Firm Inspection Report (a report of all independent auditors) ([source](https://pcaob-assets.azureedge.net/pcaob-dev/docs/default-source/inspections/reports/documents/104-2019-027-b-f-borgers-cpa-pc.pdf?sfvrsn=e4f7186d_0))

I'll let the report speak for itself:

> Certain deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework.

There are 3 pages full of deficiencies found for BF Borgers and their various clients. If you want to, you can go straight to the report to read about them.

So, while the strangeness in FTFT's auditing doesn't prove fraudulence, it certainly (at least IMO) may indicate something fishy is going on.

---

**In Conclusion...**
---

I have already purchased puts on this company though the size of my position is small. And I want to explain why as well.

---

**The Risks:**
---

Though I am very comfortable my investment decision, I recognize that risks still exists with my position. I wanted to outline the scenarios I am scared of below:

- The scariest -- I am wrong:

I have done my DD in good faith, but at the end of the day, I'm an average retail investor. I have no access to non-public info and this is not my job. I am doing this research as a hobby and thus, may have misunderstood or overlooked key pieces of information.

- I am right, but the stock price goes up:

As we all know, the market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent. I am too risk adverse for shorts so the longest time frame I can manage is August puts (there is nothing offered past that). There is no major catalyst coming that I can accurately predict and this information may not budge the market in a short enough time frame. Plus, I do not know what kind of money is behind FTFT which may prop up their stock price in the short term.

- I am right, the stock tanks, but it doesn't matter:

There are scenarios where the stock tanks, yet those who see it coming still lose money. In cases of fraud, the SEC may freeze trading on certain assets altogether until investigations are complete. If this happens, options for that asset may expire worthless as trading is frozen.

---

As always, you should make your own investment decisions off of your own research. Nothing I say is financial advise, its just 1 person delving through the internet for information on $FTFT.

Happy trading.",['NDAQ']

**Monster Valuation**

Over the weekend another player in the space (Stripe) raised $600M at a $95B valuation, and that will probably serve as a long term driver for this stock. MOGO has a $350M valuation… but that should be moving higher here as the stocks looks like it is about to break out. I think MOGO

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

A common index investing strategy is some S&P500, some international and put some away in bonds/bank (percentages don’t really matter for this example)

I’m personally from Australia so the common advice is some in Australian shares, some in international shares and some in the bank account/bonds.

The Nikkei has some big problems (in my opinion- the Bank of Japan becoming the biggest holder of it being the biggest problem). It has a problem with an aging population.

* [Here's a download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NnDo-NPqagm5oriKAxgtF46Duvbf1I45fIeQ2SwrxrU/copy)
* [Here's a View link to the data if you just want to see without downloading your own copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml#)
* If anyone wants to get into the data of it I'm happy to share the file itself, but I want to limit concurrent access to it since too many people being in the sheet is preventing me from updating

As we've all seen, everyone and their brother has a stock mention scraper these days so I thought I'd start tracking them. I was looking for the ones that would give the clearest idea of a strategy that could be carried into actual trading. So it had to have consistent updates, be reliable information, provide a useful set of measurable metrics, and be easy to copy/paste or import into Google Sheets.  
**In the end the two I landed on were:**[Unbias Stock](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php): It provides hard number scores for ticker mentions across multiple platforms[Finviz](https://finviz.com/?a=304482240): The screener section allows you to filter a lot of ways, I was interested in the ATH data  
**Methodologies:**

* Every day at market close I get all the ATH data for that day and paste it into the sheet
* Every morning just before market open I enter all the social media ticker information gets entered each morning so I can collect all the info from the full day and night before
* The sheet uses GoogleFinance functions to pull ticker ""high"" for the day each day. Google is sometimes spotty about updating so you'll see gaps in the data. I go through regularly and paste the values into the spots to lock in the data
* It calculates a lot of things, but the big things are
* What score grouping has the highest rate of profitability? (i.e. Which grouping should I look for when deciding on a stock)
* Which social media is the most profitable?
* What is the max price and % change after the date it was entered into the sheet? (i.e. What kind of limit sell should you set)
* How many days did it take to get to the max price? (i.e. How long should you hold)

**Analysis (Keep in mind that the data is constantly changing and updating):**

1. The most successful platform is Reddit. Wisdom of the Masses is a real thing
2. Set limits and take profits when they hit, holding too long every platform loses money
3. Stocks with a Reddit score of under 500 become profitable FAR, FAR more often than any other category
4. They hit their max profit on average between 4 - 8 days. After than they all start losing money
5. Average % increase (limit sell) is 15% - 17%

**Other interesting finds:**Stocks that have hit an ATH the previous day are profitable the next day 34% of the time and profitable within the next 5 days 56% of the time. If you look at the full table it's a strong, strong strategy for incremental gains. 5% - 23% gains are really consistently feasibleStockTwits LOOKS very successful when you see their hit rate, but if you look at the score categories you see that they are only successful in stocks with a score greater than 5000. That means that they are just coat tail riding on stocks that everyone else called successful long before. So they're not good at picking stocks, but they ARE good at jumping on the bandwagon as it comes screaming towards them. And it's not a terrible strategy, the average % of profit of that category is 23%**Conclusions:**Obviously I'm not qualified to give you guys advice, but what I've been using the data to do is:

1. I find stocks that have a score of under 500 in Unbias Stock and do a little digging. If they haven't popped yet I buy up the ones with the most Reddit mentions. I set a limit sell of 15% on themThis strategy has been working really well for me. I'm hitting the 15% about 75% of the time, and the ones that I don't I sell after 5 days usually somewhere between 1% and 10%. I've only taken a loss twice
2. I have recently started buying stocks at ATH and selling them within the next day or two if they hit 5%. This has been hit or miss so far
3. I started this a month ago in my RH account (it's where my play money is) and compared it to my ""responsible"" investments in my Fidelity account. They both started at the same amount and as of today my RH account is up 25% and my Fidelity is down 36% (fucking tech man)

Good luck! If anyone has any ideas of how to better parse the data let me know, I'm more than happy to make this better. ",['GOOGL']

m7aw04,,investing,post,1616015759,"Future market caps using current expectations is unsustainable. S&P500 total market cap alone would be worth $1.04 quadrillion in 50 years if grown at 7% yearly.Perhaps a hot take, but I’m having a difficult time seeing a consistent rate of return on a raw number scale.

The logical conclusion of index funds always being successful is dealing with exponential growth that is ‘expected by investors’ to reach and break through the quadrillions. 

Unless I’m missing something, is there not a point in which there is simply not enough money to support the new 7% expectation?
  
For instance right now $2.2 trillion would have to be invested into all of the S&P500 to meet the average of 7%. But in 50 years, if the market cap were $1.04 quadrillion as expected, it would take $65 trillion to maintain the same effect.

Assuming inflation in the US is stable around where it is now, consumers and perhaps even companies wouldn’t be able to invest enough to build the 7% return that they initially invested for, given that the requirement for it is exponentially growing.

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

investing.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise-holdings-of-us-treasuries-for-second-month-in-january-data-2447322

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",

m6o8ek,,investing,post,1615942777,"[CNBC] Uber grants more than 70,000 UK drivers worker status after losing major labor battle.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/uber-grants-uk-drivers-worker-status-after-losing-major-labor-battle.html

On the heels of losing a major labor battle in the United Kingdom, Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers. 

Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers will receive some benefits, including minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions, but they will not get full employee benefits. 

Uber announced the change in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, adding that its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

While the move will increase Uber’s costs in the U.K., the company is still targeting adjusted EBITDA profitability by year-end.

Earlier this year, Uber lost a major legal battle in the U.K. around this issue. The country’s Supreme Court upheld a ruling that a group of drivers were workers, not independent contractors. While the decision applied to a small group of drivers, thousands more have taken action against the company.

In an op-ed in The Evening Standard, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wrote that following the Supreme Court ruling, “we could have continued to dispute drivers’ rights to any of these protections in court. Instead, we have decided to turn the page.”

“I know many observers won’t pat us on the back for taking this step, which comes after a five-year legal battle,” Khosrowshahi said. “They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change.”

Meanwhile, Uber and the gig economy as a whole is facing regulatory challenges around the globe. Uber has spent millions battling those challenges in other regions. 

In California, Uber pushed back against Assembly Bill 5, a gig-economy law passed by the state legislature in 2019 that tightened the rules for classifying workers as independent contractors. 

After a widespread campaign, costing over $200 million — the most expensive ballot measure in the state’s history — Uber and a handful of other gig-economy companies persuaded voters to support a ballot measure called Proposition 22, which exempted Uber and other gig-economy platforms from state employment law.

In turn, gig workers received some benefits without full employment status. Some of the additional costs of providing benefits were passed on to ride-hailing customers.",['ED']

Hello, I want to do a DD today on a bad company which I've purchased puts on. $FTFT (Future Fintech), a 'fin-tech blockchain {insert buzzword}' company that I am near 100% certain is a Chinese scam.

This is not financial advice.

---

**So, what do they claim to do?**
---

Their website: www.ftft.top

Enter at your own risk. This website is not HTTPS secured and has a ""warning"" rating from Web of Trust.

According to their website, they are a leading blockchain R&D company incorporated in Florida, founded in 1998. They own and operate a blockchain-based online mall, a digital payment system, a cross-border e-commerce system, and a blockchain incubator.

WOW, they do so much!

**And where do they do it?**
---

First thing you'll notice is that while they are incorporated in Florida by their SEC filing, the actual office address is in New York City. Specifically:

*Americas Tower, 1177 Avenue of The Americas, Suite 5100, New York, NY 10036*

Now it's interesting that they have Suite 5100 because the Americas Tower actually only has 47 floors. **Suite 5100 doesn't actually exist.** I called the leasing office and they confirmed that each floor's suite is named after the floor itself. Now, maybe there is some secret floors available only to high-end clientele or maybe their counting system is different than the leasing office said. Perhaps, I'm just wrong here. We can give FTFT the benefit of the doubt and say this is a legitimate mailing address.

> EDIT: It appears that Suite 5100 is a virtual office leased out to Regus who rents out to FTFT. Thanks /u/elcup

It doesn't matter, their true operations is out of Beijing, China and this is where the fun really begins.

**A juice company turned blockchain technologist**
---

Sound strange? It gets stranger...

FTFT, in 2017 (at the height of the BTC craze) wowed investors by turning to blockchain. Why was this so surprising, because before this, they were called ""SkyPeople Fruit Juice"" and they sold fruit juice ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/19/tiny-fruit-juice-company-soars-on-speculated-move-into-bitcoin-that-likely-isnt-real.html)).

So, juice company into finance, a natural transition, right?

Well, surprisingly, no. In order to make this jump, FTFT need to start acquiring companies with financial expertise like mad. According to their website, their portfolio consists of 2 companies:

- Nova Realm City: a blockchain technology value community... whatever that means. This company is based out of China and uses the NRC coin which they claim 35 million exists. First off, only 35 million? That's extremely low float for a ""digital asset community"". Furthermore, I can find no evidence that NRC actually exists.

- InUnion: a blockchain-based life insurance platform. This company is also based out of China and as far as I can tell, it does not have its own website. The link provided by FTFT only goes to an information page with a shitty pamphlet screenshot: https://imgur.com/7YWc9OZ. Notice in the screenshot that there are still red underlines in the names as if this was a screen grab from Microsoft Word. This is the real image they used for this company... Also notice that every customer will also be considered a staff member as well as an investor. What!? WTF does that mean?

Okay, so these are the companies that FTFT publicizes for themselves. But what about the companies they don't put on their website?

**Their ""finance"" acquisitions**
---

FTFT is reportedly acquiring tons of companies to ""expand"" its business (presumably blockchain and finance business) and shore up its expertise (presumably in blockchain and finance).

A quick Google search pulls up a number of subsidiaries by FTFT:

https://imgur.com/0L70WG1

Now, let's first go through some of the companies:

- Christie Peterson Development Corporation: a company originally under H. B. Covey, Inc. which was later acquired by a non-operations company (they have no operations) Entech Environmental Technologies. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001019687-04-000739/)) What is Entech Environmental Technologies? Well, its none other than FTFT!

([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-19-005964/)) Neither of these companies have websites including Christie Peterson Development Corp.

- FT Commercial Management (Beijing): a company formed to acquire Sichuan Tema Supply Chain Management Co., Ltd. This company provides financial services to the supply chain industry. Other than that, it is impossible to find more about this company. Interestingly enough, the revenues of this company actually exceeds the **market cap** of FTFT yet they are purchasing it in common stock.

- Asiasens Investment Holding: now this one wasn't even in Google it was so recent. But they announced the acquisition here.

([Source](https://sgpgrid.com/company-details/asiasens-investment-holding-pte-ltd)) This company, which was purchased for **$15 million** of common stock, has less than 10 employees and a business address of: 195 PEARL''S HILL TERRACE, #01-05, Singapore 168976. If you look up this business address, you'll be surprised to find that it's actually... **a residential address for some dude working out of his apartment.** https://imgur.com/xsUl9Hx. Thankfully, this one was unable to get regulatory approval and has since been cancelled. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

- Blocknance Financial International SRL: This was probably the **only** blockchain company that I saw in their acquisition strategy. It is based out of the Dominican and was to be purchased in... drum roll... common stock. Unfortunately, it was also cancelled due to FTFT's inability to get regulatory approval in Hong Kong. ([Source](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-012148/))

I can go through the list of acquisitions and since the cancellation of some of their more recent acquisitions, they have already announced more. You can see this on their own website. https://www.ftft.top/en/news.html.

Here is the absolutely terrifying part: **EVERY ACQUISITION IS PAID FOR IN COMMON STOCK.** Not only this, but they are diluting their common stock as quickly as possible through direct offers where they issue more stock in exchange for cash. This is all found on their own website!

In my personal opinion, this is a house of cards just waiting to fall.

**So, what part of their business IS legitimate?**
---

Well, they are rather proud of their ""Chain Cloud Mall"", a blockchain based online retail front...

It is true that they own an online storefront which can be found here: http://www.gksharedmall.com/

Now, right off the bat it seems like a normal online retail site. It has no mention of blockchain or any blockchain-related technology, but let's let that slide for a second. If you go on the front page and click on any of the advertised products, you'll notice one glaring problem with this site: **NONE OF ITS PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE**.

What???

Try it yourself. Change your location to Beijing or another center of commerce in China even. I tried 10+ products and could not make a single purchase no matter my location. All of it is unavailable so unless they had the most monstrous selling season in the history of ever, or these products were never available for sale in the first place. So wtf is this site then? Short answer: I have no idea.

Okay, maybe let's try their next product, NONOGIRL, a global e-commerce platform whose trial launched about a year ago in April of 2020...

It doesn't exist. There's no mention of it ever again. It either never went live or never existed in the first place.

DCON, a coin touted by FTFT for blockchain incubation and technical services!

And... it also doesn't exist: https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R.

---

So, wtf does FTFT even do? They are acquiring internal advertisement companies, supply chain financing companies, asset management companies, and insurance companies. The **ONLY** blockchain related company they sought to acquire actually failed to go through due to regulations.

I have no idea what this company does, if it does anything. All I know is that they are liquidating their shares as quickly as humanly possible. Everything they purchase is through shares. They probably offer the baristas in Starbucks common share instead of cash. This looks like a penny stock pretending to not be a penny stock with wild acquisitions announced every week that never go through.

Is this company a fraud designed to drain investor cash? I can't say for sure. But my findings are above and you should make your own decision.

> EDIT: Looks like they have an SEC filing for a massive dilution of shares. Though, this is dated Feb 26 and it hasn't hit the market yet. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=14748787&RcvdDate=2/26/2021&CoName=FUTURE%20FINTECH%20GROUP%20INC.&FormType=DEF%2014C&View=html - Thanks /u/boatbitter","['GOOGL', 'NDAQ', 'MSFT', 'SBUX']"

m7c1ig,gract6k,investing,comment,1616019038,"Sorry the comment is below.....it's brilliant:

Part I:

\------------

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.","['ED', 'PWR']"

2. They are looking to hire more people than their competitors. Nvidia has currently around 1000 open positions, compared to 700 for AMD and 650 for Intel. This tells me that the company is growing. But it’s also interesting to see what kind of people they are hiring. I like that they are looking to hire people for their Autonomous Vehicles Platform - huge future opportunity.
3. Highest employee rating in the industry. People like working for Nvidia (if we should trust sites like Glassdoor and Indeed), more so than their competitors. The CEO approval is at an all time high and I believe that this will help them attract even more great people in the future.

LUNA  IMOA is a long hold that has a  chance at super rocketing at any time.  LUNA should be up around 20  dollars a share by Xmas, or alot sooner  depending on ARK

Luna   Innovations, Inc. engages in the development and manufacture of fiber   optic test and measurement, sensing, and instrumentation products for   the automotive, aerospace, energy, and infrastructure industries. It   operates Products and Licensing; and Technology Development segment. The   Products and Licensing segment include sale of fiber optic test,   measurement, and control instruments and modules. The Technology   Development segment focuses in the provision of applied research for   customers in primary areas of focus, including sensing and materials   such as coatings, adhesives, composites, and bio-engineered materials.   The company was founded by Kent A. Murphy in July 1990 and is   headquartered in Roanoke, VA.

Luna Innovations ([LUNA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUNA?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating   leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as   its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently   trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the   balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2   analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to   Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an   EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe   these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line   growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna  is a fiber optic testing company  that uses fiber in a unique way. As  such, it lacks head-to-head  competition in many of its markets. This  lack of competition is  obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is  also detrimental as no  Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover  the company as it has no  peers to amortize the coverage effort over or  to compare to on a  valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two  divisions, Lightwave  and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter,  Lightwave comprised 73% of  the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.

The   Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself   split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and   Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses   fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature,   acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These   capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the   Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being   destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors   and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring   of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter   but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited  infrastructure  bill is passed in the United States. Smart  infrastructure is topical now  and Luna would likely benefit from any  incremental projects in this  area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:[RDS.A](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.A?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) (NYSE:[RDS.B](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDS.B?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil   and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses   in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When   deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with   unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more   efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large   opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt ([OTCPK:MEGGF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)),   a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be   used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus   planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing   aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat   due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a   long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take   advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s   sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite   materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness   must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron   thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on   radar.

Luna also recently inked a   deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful   of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different   environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being   used in production vehicles, not just test cases.

These   Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s   technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each   year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land   Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the   US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:[LMT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link))   uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its   F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the   past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered  this  year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of  over $6  million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small  company like  Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for  testers to be  used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity  for testers to  be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop  Grumman (NYSE:[NOC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)).

Financial   firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna.   Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in   trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s   testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics.   These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are   becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips   during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure   they perform up to specification.

Luna’s   other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding   to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna   can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of   Luna’s entire business.

Luna is   experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster   than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division   are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about   28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%.   Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a   bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve   as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the   overall pie.

What is the right  way  to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps,  it  is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. I   forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and  EBITDA  to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its  fixed  cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA  in  2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of  20x  to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160%  return  from current levels.

>On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


>*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


>*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


>*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


>*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


>*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

>The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**","['GPS', 'PGR']"

m7kef8,,investing,post,1616047266,"ADC -- Agree Realty, the omnichannel equity REITI know most on this sub aren't focused on equity REITS, but I remain very bullish real estate this year and in the next thousand years. You are, of course, buying a piece of Earth. When that piece of Earth generates income and the company is doing everything it can to grow... you should at least consider allocating a portion of it to your portfolio. Dividend focused companies are growth companies, too.

Agree (pronounced Ay-gree) focuses on investment grade, recognizable tenants such as Walmart. They are mostly triple net but do on occasion assist with development efforts, which aligns with how they describe their best tenants as partners. They're a bit unusual here--like STOR, a non-IG counterpart--in that they actively work with powerful companies rather than being a merely absentee landlord. Yet they still benefit from the high margins of triple net leasing--gross profit hovers at 87%, net income at 36%.

They also are working with some ground leases. Tenant vacates, they get the land at no cost. This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings. Credit goes to them.","['AMZN', 'TGT', 'WMT']"

m7gkv9,,investing,post,1616033038,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS)Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advise. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis. 

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

# Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:**  [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically.

m6zzhm,,investing,post,1615986444,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.","['INTC', 'NVDA', 'TXN', 'IBM', 'ARKK', 'MMM', 'BA', 'QCOM', 'TER']"

Does “short cash position” mean holding little cash, or actually borrowing cash?

Does non-dollar assets mean holding companies stock instead of cash/bonds, or meaning holding non-US companies instead of US-companies?

m6w42x,gr7ymhr,investing,comment,1615973992,"Need some advice here.

I’m 24, have ~100k in savings, and ~3k monthly disposable income.

No debt, no assets, not even a proper citizenship - I’m from a country where human rights are a fairytale, and live in a place where I have little chances to naturalise.

I want to grow my savings as much as possible though I have relatively low risk tolerance. I might need to use this money in, say, 3-5 years for a house (best case), or as a rescue fund at any time if something goes wrong with my job or immigration situation (worst case).

As for the disposable component, I’m more comfortable with riskier options.

I have very little financial knowledge, and just a little bit of exposure to the markets as a long time lurker.

Now my worry is that most of the good companies I’ve kept an eye on have grown to be overpriced, and even a no-brainer SPY looks like it’s about to start bleeding, all things considered. For example, I had TSLA on my watchlist since it was under $200 pre-split, and I didn’t buy.

Another problem is that I’m afraid of inflation. They printed so much money in the states, and the market is pumped, so this whole situation will just eat away my cash if I don’t do anything.

I think getting into stable dividend stocks with the savings, and DCA into a growth index or two with occasional risky purchases with the income would be a good play.

m6wb43,,investing,post,1615972423,"Economic Moat/Competitive advantageWhat Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity. Facebooks product and brand is so powerful, even its strongest and fiercest critics still use it.

Amazon is Jeff’s flywheel. More customers = more revenue to invest in CapEx = more capabilities/lower prices = more customers. There’s a massive CapEx moat if you want to enter the logistics or data center business.

Intel is the only one I disagree with here. I don’t think Intel follows the tick tock model anymore. Originally I’d say their moat was their state of the art fabs but that lead has been ceded to TSM. Intel is struggling against AMD and NVIDIA right now and is losing share. What you have down was correct about a decade ago, today it doesn’t hold.","['AAPL', 'INTC', 'FB', 'AMD', 'NVDA', 'AMZN']"
m6wb43,gr8kdhs,investing,comment,1615989734,"I think Buffett's ""competitive moat"" differs somewhat from durable competitive advantage and rarely applies to tech because the the ideas are at odds with each other, and here's why:

What Buffett has said about competitive moat is... If you think about chewing gum or soda, advancements in technology aren't going to change how we consume chewing gum or soda in 100 years.  So, Wrigley's and Coca-Cola's existing business model is going to stay on top of those industries for a long time to come.

While Apple and Amazon have moats, theirs are probably more what I'd call moats of scale than competitive moats.  They and Facebook basically figured out how to run vertical monopolies in a space that is widely unregulated.   The valley calls this a ""product/service ecosystem""... but it's essentially a vertical monpoly which could be obliterated the moment that regulatory oversight changes or their business model collapses under its own weight as Facebook's is beginning to.

It's nothing to do with the fact that people will still use the same tech 100 years from now.  They won't be using the same tech six months from now.

That being said, you'll notice that Berkshire has a material stake in both Apple and Amazon, but I suspect that will change faster than some of their other investments like Coca-Cola which is probably one of the most widely diversified food and beverage conglomerates in existence today, vastly outweighing the once legendary Grand Metropolitan, the beverage company whose acquisition of Pillsbury in 1989 is the stuff of legend.

m6lakz,,investing,post,1615933928,"Plug power - unravelling the jargonI do love having a go at deciphering the management bullsh8t when they have dodgy accounts (sorry if you own it). Here is my stab... the stuff in brackets is my deciphering attempt.


Company:
Adjustments on the balance sheets to reduce the carrying amount of certain right of use assets and finance obligations associated with leases.... 


(Overestimated the value of the leases they have entered into. Reduction in size of assets and associated lease expense).  


 Company:
·An increase in the loss accrual relating to certain service contracts;


(Probably more serious that the above. They have mispriced service contracts and need to account for more losses as a result).  
 

Company:
·Recognition of non-cash impairment charges relating to certain long-lived assets, including certain right of use assets and certain fixed assets;


(Probably the most serious. These assets being impaired are non-cash in nature now... but they would have been cash at some point, e.g. capex to build these assets. At its more nefarious... they paid money or provided capex to customers and they just aren't getting the benefits back).  
 

Company:
·A reclassification of certain costs resulting in a decrease in Operating expenses - Research and development expense and a corresponding increase in Cost of revenue


(Overestimated the gross margin, cost moving from development to cost of service. Therefore less tech spend... more manufacturing and service spend).

....

All in all seems pretty serious to me. That last set of accounts were a big red flag with negative revenue being delivered. In these situations its a good opportunity to scan the last set of accounts... see what  you could haven't learnt and what to watch out for.

Edit: The comment about non-cash by the company really annoys me. Suppose plug power raised 1bn from investors. They spent that money building a factory they expect to return 100m a year. A year later it turns out they are getting 20m and that factory should only be worth 200m. That's okay then! (Sarcasm) because its non cash... well sorry that 800m was cash one day... cash we gave you. You destroyed it when you spent it. You are just telling us you did today.

Edit: Suggest 5bn to 10bn is about right for this business... and this is optimistic. That would put it at about 10 to 20 usd. That might sound crazy but that is only where it was 4 months ago.",

m69ifj,,investing,post,1615902668,"US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis)**General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*","['NDAQ', 'BLK', 'UPS']"

**Recommendation: BUY SMG with a 18-24 month price target of $275 (P/E, EV/EBITDA, Perp. Growth), representing a 17% upside from the current price.**
SMG is NOT a marijuana stock, and comparisons to the regular ""Reddit basket"" of marijuana stocks is disingenuous to SMG's business model. It is a gardening and cultivation stock that recently acquired a hydroponics company that gives the company exposure to the marijuana market from a distance. Due to this, they trade at lower betas and valuation multiples than typical marijuana stocks and still source revenue from their regular gardening US Consumer Segment, currently supplemented by Hawthorne which is exploding in growth.

**Two Catalyst Events:** Virtual Investor Day on 4/8/21 and 2Q20 Earnings on 5/5/21. Both these days will allow the opportunity for the management to update their guidance and tone on FY21 and the future. Emphasis can be expected on Hawthorne and projections for growth.

**Company Overview:** The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company manufactures, markets, and sells consumer lawn and garden products in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: U.S. Consumer, Hawthorne, and Other. 

**US Consumer:** It offers lawn care products, such as lawn fertilizers, grass seed products, spreaders, other durable products, and outdoor cleaners, as well as lawn-related weed, pest, and disease control products. The company also provides gardening and landscape products, including water-soluble and continuous-release plant foods, potting mixes and garden soils, mulch and decorative ground cover products, plant-related pest and disease control products, organic garden products, and lives goods and seeding solutions. 

**Hawthorne:** In addition, it offers hydroponic products that help users to grow plants, flowers, and vegetables using little or no soil; lighting systems and components for use in hydroponic and indoor gardening applications; and insect, rodent, and weed control products for home areas. 

---
**Hawthorne Analysis**: This is the growth portion of SMG and where this analysis is focused. Historically focused on lawn and garden products, SMG completed their acquisition of two hydroponics companies in 2015 to move into the marijuana market in 2015 operating under the name Hawthorne, which currently makes up ¼ of SMG’s revenue. 

* With pending marijuana reform on a state and federal level, Hawthorne is primed to explode in growth over the next five years off the back of a Democratic majority in the Legislative branch in support of reform – blue wave is hot and GA runoff wins are positive for outlook. 
* Management is extremely bullish on Hawthorne’s potential in the near and long-term (noted in 4Q20 ([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/7ee63590-92ad-4aae-a1fe-d2a99ac12e1e)) and 1Q21([Release](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-record-first-quarter-results-us)/[Call](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/33c0d8bc-8fa5-4393-9532-e49494e12ad7)) earnings and [Raymond James Investors Conference](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/05623e13-ae53-4f8c-89ac-6d4bd767db48) + [Truist Consumer Symposium](https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/static-files/fd136668-3d44-433d-910e-16969ee69297) presentations in 1Q20). Hawthorne was growing 70% YoY back to June 2019; shows the velocity of growth pre-pandemic.
* Markets like Michigan and Oklahoma were stifled by COVID in 2020 and are expected to rebound in 2021/2022. New markets including NY, PA, and VA are planning and implementing marijuana reform bulls and are expected to open in the coming years. These markets can potentially grow to compose a majority of future Hawthorne revenue. SMG recently completed the construction of a R&D facility in British Columbia and will allow the company to push new products and methods to supplement their Hawthorne product line (notes below on facility). 

---
**US Consumer Analysis:** The company has performed incredibly well through COVID as consumers improve their garden and lawn in lockdowns nationwide; revenue was up 30% in FY2020. Growth is expected to continue this US Consumer segment as COVID impact falls into the summer and consumers return to retail stores with stimulus money in their pockets. 

* Management went in depth into their US Consumer segment at the RJ Investors Conference (linked above) so more color can be found there. Mgmt called it a ""sticky industry"" where 80-90% of consumers come back the next year to buy more SMG products. Competitors are present on retail shelves, but the staying power is with SMG, not the rest.
* The segment found incredible revenue (especially compared to many industries) during COVID as people were stuck at home over the summer and rebuilding their gardens and lawns.

* Reported 1Q profit: first time ever in company history (business is seasonal with strong 2Q and 3Q)
* 1Q sales for Hawthorne increased 71% to $156m. Strong demand in all categories of Hawthorne
* 1Q sales for US Consumer increased 147% to $408m. Purchases at retail partners increased 40%
* Heavy investment into marketing – Super Bowl ad, “targeted and driven” approach to social media

**Outlook on Performance**

* Noted in the 1Q21 earnings linked above.
* Full company FY21 sales growth of 1%-6%
* US Consumer expected ""positive sales growth"" (SMG updated guidance on US Consumer on 3/1/21)
* Hawthorne FY21 sales growth of 20%-30%

**State Legalization Progress**

* New York: NY Senate Bill S854 would legalize for recreational use. Cuomo: “Not only will legalizing and regulating the adult-use cannabis market provide the opportunity to generate much-needed revenue, but it also allows us to directly support the individuals and communities that have been most harmed by decades of cannabis prohibition.”
* Virginia: On 02/27/2021, the VA General Assembly approved legislation that would legalize the sale and possession of recreational marijuana for adult recreational use beginning on January 1, 2024. Governor has not yet signed the legislation and may propose amendments that would speed up the effective date of the proposed law.
* New Jersey: On 02/22/2021, NJ Governor Murphy signed into law the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), legalizing marijuana for adult recreational use in New Jersey and prohibiting employers from taking adverse action against employees solely because they use marijuana.
* Pennsylvania: PA Governor has made several calls for state legalization, working on legislation.
* South Dakota: Voters approved a medical marijuana program in the state, but Governors and the legislature have introduced bills to delay the implementation of the program.
* Other states: CT, FL, HI, MD, ND, OK all have introduced bills into the legislature for marijuana reform.

**R&D Facility in Kelowna, BC**

* Laboratories, indoor grow suites, training areas. Testing cultivation systems and techniques using lighting, fertilization and irrigation systems, growing mediums, and research protocols. 
* Also includes research on cannabis genetics and growing systems to provide cannabis products.
* Innovation is the keyword for Hawthorne. Especially with LED lights, innovation will allow Scotts to push new products.
* Mgmt had a great point elucidated in the Raymond James Conference: Compare Hawthorne to TV. TV’s have lasted forever, but innovation is strong. You likely do not have your 20-year-old tube TV even though it may work. SMG pushing innovative products and methods to marijuana cultivation promote a sphere of influence in the cultivation industry.

**Model Assumptions and Valuation**

I've also created a financial model that includes a DCF valuation with three share price calculations (P/E, EV/EBITDA, and Perpetual Growth). While the confidence of each method is medium, the fact that each method implies around the same share price raises the confidence level. Excerpts of relevant sections are attached. A screenshot of the [Unlevered Free Cash Flow Buildup is attached here.](https://i.imgur.com/t6Wo7hL.png)

[Revenue Growth Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/USmgg83.png)

* Assume 6% revenue growth in FY21, with USC, Hawthorne, and Other growing at 0.5%, 21.6% and 31.1% respectively, congruent with management's guidance above.

[General Income Statement Assumptions](https://i.imgur.com/1dPFEW0.png)

* Gross Profit Margin is expected to ""decline 125 to 175 basis points"" in FY21, and the GP Margin assumptions reflect this.
* In connection with SMG's acquisition of Sunlight Supply in 3Q18, they announced a company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Operating Margin assumptions reflect this rise.

[WACC was pulled directly from Bloomberg, and is 8.7%.](https://imgur.com/a/Qm2XNZv)

**Valuation Results**

*Perpetual Growth*:
A perpetual growth rate of 2.10% was chosen for this calculation by [finding the sumproduct of SMG's geographical share of revenue and the respective GDP growth for each region](https://i.imgur.com/tDa8BcY.png). ""International"" is defined by the G7 countries minus America. 

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/yTRXXV7.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs Growth rate [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/CiA78BQ.png)
* Implied Share Price is $271.59


*EV/EBITDA*: An exit multiple of 14.1x was chosen for the exit EV/EBITDA exit multiple method. Included companies in the comparables analysis to arrive at the exit multiple include CHD, CF, MOS and CTVA.

* The terminal value calculation [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/HucM0qV.png)
* And a sensitized analysis of WACC vs EV/EBITDA [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/hxw2gQe.png)
* Implied share price is $271.75

*Price To Earnings*: A simple P/E comparable was also included, but since comparables to SMG are far and few between, it is not a truly strong data point. P/E used the same comparable companies as the EV/EBTIDA calculation, and a screenshot [is attached here](https://i.imgur.com/jxipRSs.png).

* Implied share price is $281.57

**Recap**: Huge growth in Hawthorne makes SMG a prime play for returns with a 17% upside from current valuations. Hawthorne is exploding and you want to get in on the fround floor before legalization occurs with the current ""blue wave"" and cultivation becomes more common. SMG has ""sticky"" US Consumer segment that currently makes up 75% of their revenue, but Hawthorne is expected to cannibalize this revenue and result in a USC/Hawthorne revenue split of 55%/45% in the coming years. My model has forecasted the growing potential of the company and arrived at a 17% upside for SMG.

They are able to appeal to the vanity of their customers in the quest for a perfect lawn by selling upscale packaging and lawn photographs.  Being able to sell fertilizer for $20 a bag and dirt for $5 a bag is no easy task but they do it.  The problem is see here is transferring those skills to the marijuana play.  Marketing the way Scott’s does won’t work the same way and it may actually form part of the regulations that come out on legalization.  The government wants the revenues but they don’t want giant dope leaf advertising everywhere.  The subdued nature of the rollout will restrict their upside and not allow them to play to their strengths.  Time and acceptance of the new market may change this however.,

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.


Criticism over app-store fees increased last year after Epic Games, the Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong)-backed maker of Fortnite, launched a public campaign against Apple and Google over the fees related to the app store. Apple booted Fortnite off the store, and Epic filed an antitrust suit over the issue.

Shares of Alphabet have advanced 95% in the past year, as the S&P 500 gained 69%.","['GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'SPGI']"

m60b98,,investing,post,1615866531,"I have to be missing something about the EV spaceI have been in the markets since college, about 6 years ago. I am not an expert and have my fair share of misses. This isnt a typical ""doomsday"" post. In my 6 years, I've heard every year that the stock market was about to collapse. I think its possible the stock market faces a ""lost decade"", but I am also a big believer in the innovation within the pipeline that we could benefit from in the coming years.

One area of the market I am confused by is the electric vehicle space. It seems everyone is so high on the space when I think it presents a lot of risks:

1. A lot of EV companies are trading like they will be the dominant player in the EV space and have a large % of TAM. In reality, very few of these companies will win any significant amount of TAM and many of them will crash (no pun intended). In the last few years, we've seen the EV space expand from Tesla to Volkswagen to General Monitors/Ford to the darling SPAC companies. Many of these companies have never sold a electric car to the general public.
2. The car industry is a tough industry to invest in. In my investing career, the car industry has been the ugly orange haired stepchild. Too many companies, large capital requirements, and tough margins. I dont understand how the EV space would change that. Sure, certain technologies might make manufacturing easier that can improve margins and lower capital requirements... but you are still going to pinching every penny, especially if the market remains this saturated.
3. Many EV car companies are dependent on certain tax credits and government handouts. We can argue the merits of the government incentivizing people to buy cars and the merits of the government giving money away to help car companies be competitive. How reliable are these credits in the future?
4. It's great you want an electric car to save the planet, but if your EV charging station is powered by coal, or oil/gas, you arent doing as much good as you think. The charging stations seem to need a lot of further infrastructure. I dont think many, if any, markets globally have the infrastructure in place to account for the expected increase in EV vehicles, much less EV charging stations built using power from ""clean"" sources.
5. EDIT: I thought of one more. All of these companies will likely need to raise huge amounts of money in the future. Many of them are pre-revenue and still have to invest millions, if not billions, into infrastructure. The ability to raise money now is easy, but it might not be so easy in a few years. 

I dont pretend to be an expert at this. My research is still on going and my ignorance might be showing here. However, I just see an industry that is growing in awareness and therefore stock valuations, but still have many questions and less answers.

I have seen some short reports in recent weeks. If anything, I'd buy General Monitors and buy LEAP puts in SPAC EV companies. I think the existing ICE car companies like Volkswagen, Ford, and GM... along with Tesla, have a huge advantage over some of these smaller players.","['GM', 'ICE', 'TSLA']"

m60b98,gr3r6j2,investing,comment,1615884824,"This was an honest question, and I will do my best at giving an honest, non-hype no BS answer as good practice to articulate my thoughts on the space. (*Disclaimer:* I could be defined as a mega-bull on the what I'll call broadly the 'electrification' opportunity that faces the world in the 1-2 coming **decades,** EVs being a big part of that). I'll start with my thoughts and then answer your questions. I also work in the space, and have been following it as an energy nerd for...a long time).

I would say **I am very concerned** about the 'EV froth' right now. With so many companies with NO technology specific manufacturing expertise OR product available to sell (lots of companies with visions, maybe some smart people, and fat piles of cash). We have those companies' valuations comparing in some cases to legacy auto companies or whole divisions. And these are companies with beloved brands, and they have domain experience in manufacturing, servicing and selling vehicles. (**Note: they do not have specific technology experience though**). It is pretty mind blowing. There is going to be lots of hurt at some point, but I do feel I have a reasonably clear picture as to how this is likely to end up playing out.

A few important 'bits' of knowledge on the space that I view has helpful in framing any particular opportunity (feel free to do your own independent research on the validity of each of them):

* **Where are the batteries?** The biggest constraint and challenge for getting EVs sold into customer hands for **at least** the next 5 years, if not decade or more - is the answer to the question of: *where are you getting your batteries from? EXACTLY?* Which factory? When does it start its production? Is it a reputable tier 1, tier 2, or lower tier supplier? At what scale of this supply have they been promised? Pre-paid? Without any clear plan or answer on this, it is very much buyer beware for me. You can go into a rabbit hole on this one all the way to which specific metals will be needed. Note that in general, the mines or factories have not even had the shovel hit the ground yet. This is a race of industrialization.
* **EVs** **are significantly cheaper to operate, and have a cost structure that makes them attractive for commercial use, fleets, business use, and productive capacity.** A quick primer as to how this breaks down: higher upfront costs (50-100% more) BUT, that same piece of equipment can go 4-5x of the usage (EVs are million mile vehicles / 1.6million kms vs 150k miles or 300k kilometres for ICE cars generally). This means depreciation of the vehicle per mile can be in excess of 1/4. Maintenance, with dozens of moving components rather than hundreds, is also fractions cheaper. Energy to drive it is fractions cheaper too. So assuming you as an operator have 'charging' solved and a use pattern that can fit within that, this is fantastic and very desirable. No f\*cks about the environment given here.
* **Technology S-curves and how technologies products are adopted:** The first of anything you make is the hardest. Each following unit produced is easier. So the 1000th unit was harder and less profitable than the 100,000ths, and millionth, and so forth. This means that as you experience magnitude increases in units shipped, you get material decreases in unit costs. Its the same higher level phenomenon as the more known Moore's Law, that technology improvement is exponential. Where for Moore's Law we talk exponential growth in the number of transistors for a given 'consumer chip' or application, we are talking about the exponential decreases in costs of Li-ion batteries, and other associated technologies. Given this is exponential (and has historically not been projected as such) these cost declines will arrive much sooner than all the mainstream analysts expect. A good starting point for your own independent research, is to see how accurate historic predictions have been. (note, really really off, by really really underestimating progress).
* **Autonomous vehicles are, conservatively - the wildcard**. While its a whole topic on its own, once it comes about (whether in a 1 year as a Tesla FSD optimist or well over a decade by say the pessimists) it will radically transform the economics of transportation in general (both as users and providers) so this needs to either be understood, or treated as its own 'risk'.

Comments on your views on risks:

1. Agreed. Many of them are vapour. Must be very careful and cautious.
2. Agreed, selling (often commodity) equipment in industries with mature technology is a tough business. Autos have been a notoriously difficult industry to start and run a business in due to all the levels of complexity. This applies to **every single player**.
3. In general, and particularly in the medium term, this doesn't matter. The technology and products can stand on their own feet (unlike say, our two molecule friend) and market structures and incentives here I view more as fuel on a fire than support. The horse has left the barn on this one, can't put it back in. (see previous point on exponentially decreasing costs)
4. While valid in an immediate term and will cause resistance through the adoption curve, two things that I've seen being in the space: the infrastructure is actually complicated to building out charging is mostly standard, equipment - its mostly a question of capital (and therefore the math). Also, given that for residentially owned vehicles for personal use, the vast majority of charging will occur at the home. For fleets, in lots or depots where concentrated hardware can be utilized. Costs of building this out are high though and do not benefit with the same degree of cost curve declines as the vehicles. And for clean sources, like Wind and Solar - you would be surprised at how quickly they can be ramped up and put online. Solar in particular can be turn capital into energy producing assets (perpetually) faster than anything we have ever seen before. (Shale maybe, but its more of a burst rather than a long time trickle.) I do not see this as a constraint.
5. Agreed. That is why I don't think anyone who doesn't have the infrastructure already or the ability to create it (within the EV market specifically) to get to a point where they can generate positive cash flows, I assumed  it to be 'dead' in my books unless proven otherwise.

&#x200B;

I know its been long, but I hope it was worthy of the read. I can always write and share more if there are specific questions.

Edit: And answering your high level question about what you are missing, its that in my view and what I've seen, TSLA has been the one that has derisked a lot of the market and made the manufacturing progress (turning clearly cash flow positive forward looking as of January 2020....hmm) where they have crossed the chasm and are now on, a product manufacturing driven rocket ship. These other companies and the space have enjoyed the rising tides, hype, capital, and knowledge that it is possible. Then comes, the greed, the frauds, the bubble, and the damage. When the tide goes out, who will have no clothes? That is the core of what I think you might be missing about the space.","['ICE', 'TSLA']"

&nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

&nbsp;

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&nbsp;

---

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

&nbsp;

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

Q4 earnings miss GAAP EPS off by 7.7%.  FCF analysis puts fair value at $134.  DCF EPS even lower.

It doesn't matter that they had a strong quarter.  What matters is that they set an expectation with investors and missed it by almost 8% or 11.7 cents per share (~$311 million total) in a year where they had been beating earnings by double digit percentages and hadn't had an EPS miss since Q4 2020.  Prices were moving on that expectation and when it failed to materialize, investors penalized WMT.

This continues to further Graham and Buffett's view that stocks trading in excess of their fair value are more susceptible to downward pressure particularly when the market is pricing in earnings that don't materialize as expected.   It should be noted that Buffett doesn't ""buy the ... dip""....

you buy 100 shares at $10 with 10% dividend and market cap of 10 thousand( and the outstanding shares are 1000) that means

if the price goes up to  $20 what would change?

well the market cap would change to 20 thousand but the outstanding shares stayed the same :(

but your dividend percentage would also change :( to 5%

so your dividend would be the (market cap \* the percentage) / the number of shares 1000) \* the amount of shares you own would be still be $100  woot same money!

m6iaod,gr5wuro,investing,comment,1615927239,"

With respect to common stock, the stock price is not a direct function of dividends, but it is indirectly a function of earnings and thus profit.  So if profits were high, the share price may be driven up but so too is the dividend payout.

But there's also the precondition that for common stock dividends to be paid out, preferred stock dividends are paid first.  In most cases modern investors want common stock because it carries voting rights and a variable but higher dividend.  The preferred shares carry no voting rights and a lower dividend calculated after the company's income taxes.  However, this dividend is fixed for the life of the preferred share class.  A company can elect to defer dividends but the common stockholders won't get paid dividends until the preferred shares dividends are paid out first.

I have a situation where I sold T and replaced it with TBB because while I have confidence in the scale of AT&T's competitive moat, I'm not 100% sure that, as underpriced as T is, shareholders will drive the stock price up substantially in the near term.  So, I decided to purchase 500 shares of TBB.   If the preferred shares rise in price, I can sell them.  If they don't, I'm guaranteed a 5.5% payout ratio for as long as I hold the stock.",
m6iaod,gr68t4c,investing,comment,1615932838,"The company decides what to do with their budget.   

Some spend all their money (wisely or not).  The goal is to grow the business,  build another factory, or buy more trucks or whatever.   Sometimes that means buy a smaller company.   If they grow wisely,  the value of the stock goes up.

Some try to grow, but slowly,  maybe there aren't any good opportunities at the time so they could buy back their stock with the extra cash.  This makes the value of the stock go up. 

Some return the money to the shareholders as dividends. 

You can find different combinations of these.  Some growing companies may periodically pay a one off special dividend. Others pay a small but routine dividend, and grow or buy back shares depending on opportunities.   Others just keep stable and pay most of the profits as dividends, and as the years roll on with inflation they will try to raise the dividend every year. 

Each of the attract different types of investors so they try to stick with a strategy. For example, retired people like to count on dividends as income so you see utilities finance growth with bonds and maintain the dividend because if they cut the dividend those people would all sell.

**Introduction** 

During a casual scroll through the dregs of Robinhood, I stumbled upon a listing that caught my eye: Future Fintech ($FTFT), a China-based “blockchain e-commerce financial technology company” that’s up an impressive 455% over the past year. Featuring a market cap of \~$500m and share price of \~$5.50 (at the time of discovery), it appeared at first glance to be a player in a hot sector with plenty of room to run. I decided to do a deep-dive into their history, products, and SEC filings as an exercise in due diligence.  

What I found was bewildering – and a great lesson in why doing your own thorough research before investing is vital. Let’s take a look at what I found. 

**A Brief Company History** 

$FTFT wasn’t always a pioneer in one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street. Before pivoting to blockchain, e-commerce and crypto in 2018, $FTFT produced and sold fruit juice - yes, seriously - as SkyPeople Foods Holding Ltd. (“SkyPeople”). The carcass of the company dates all the way back to 1998, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on their recent history. 

SkyPeople was brought onto the NASDAQ via secondary offering through underwriters Rodman & Renshaw (featured in the documentary *The China Hustle*), who have a history of bringing sketchy Chinese microcap companies to market and [violating Finra rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/business/finra-fines-rodman-renshaw-for-analysts-actions.html). Interestingly, SkyPeople settled a [$2.2m class action lawsuit](https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1046/SPU00_01/2013913_r01s_11CV02700.pdf) (.pdf link) in 2013 for overstating their revenues by **1,000%** and failing to disclose a **related-party transaction** involving their former CFO, Yongke Xue (now board chairman), to shareholders. 

According to their latest [10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020037363/f10q0920_futurefintech.htm), the transition to their latest business focus hasn’t been going so well: “The Company incurred operating losses and had negative operating cash flows, which raised **substantial doubts about its ability to continue** as a going concern” (pg. 7). As of September 30, 2020, positive operating cashflows were predominantly related to stock compensation and discontinued operations – not their stated core business (pg. 3). The quick ratio for their 3Q2020 financials (0.057) indicates that the company doesn’t have adequate liquid assets to cover their short-term liabilities. 

  
Compounding their troubles is a **subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement** issued on February 21, 2020, addressing their accounting practices, management oversight, and the sale of one of their subsidiaries (pg. 16). Note that this critical piece of information is missing from their website’s [news page](http://ftft.top/en/news.html). 

Their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm) \- the last one filed with the SEC - details their routine, schizophrenic changes in name and business focus since 1998, as well as their suspiciously complicated and web-like organizational structure, portrayed on a [chart](https://imgur.com/PNFqHLj) (pg. 4) featuring font so small that it’s impossible to read.  

In addition to being an industry leader in juice production and blockchain technology, $FTFT is also an innovator in taking out loans, leases, and service contracts, defaulting on them, and getting slapped with judgements in court, boasting an impressive record of [**20 defaults and lawsuits**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm#a_006) in six years (2014-2019, pgs. 42-45).  Furthermore, they’ve regularly been in danger of being delisted by NASDAQ due to their **persistent failure to file reports on time** (pg. 40). 

Now that we’ve scratched the surface of this industry heavyweight’s complex history, let’s examine $FTFT’s products and services. 

**Blockchain, E-Commerce, and Crypto – Oh My!** 

According to $FTFT’s website, [www.ftft.top](http://www.ftft.top/), their core revenue generators revolve around blockchain-enabled e-commerce. We’ll take a brief, critical look at each of them below. 

**“Chain Cloud Mall”,** AKA “GK Shared Mall” ([www.gksharedmall.com](http://www.gksharedmall.com/)), is described on their website as an “...innovative B2B2C e-commerce platform created by well-known investment bankers, e-commerce and blockchain technology industry elites, financial technology experts, and sharing economy scholars."" In reality, it appears to be a standard, boring retail platform, absent of any evidence whatsoever that blockchain & fintech “experts” and “scholars” were involved in its creation, or that blockchain technology is even in place at all. It’s replete with dead links and has seemingly little engagement. In fact, according to their [2019 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001066923/000121390020035017/f10k2019a1_futurefintech.htm), it generated an abysmal **$0.54m** in revenue from a total of **6,401 users**. 

**“NONOGIRL”** is a “cross-border e-commerce platform” that, in reality, appears to be a standard-web auction site that was seemingly [abandoned 7 months ago](https://imgur.com/aH4B94h) according to the NONOGIRL LinkedIn page. It’s unclear if the site was ever launched; searches on [www.baidu.com](http://www.baidu.com/) and the Google Play Store return no direct results to the platform. 

**“DCON”** is a “blockchain-based application incubator and technical service and support for real name and blockchain based assets” that appears to be dead in the water, as [the associated coin never appears to have been released](https://imgur.com/lq9vu2R). No development updates are available on $FTFT’s website for either the “incubator” project or the DCON platform itself. 

**Conclusion** 

All publicly available evidence points toward this name being an incredibly risky investment with a hefty amount of downside looming overhead. Major red flags abound – and to those holding long positions in this company: **invest with caution**.

m5kkxa,,investing,post,1615814594,"Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

It’s common knowledge that the stock market in the USA has crushed the rest of the world (I’ll use EAFE here to proxy for non-U.S. developed market equities) since the peak of the Japan bubble (call that the end of 1989) or over the last, say, ten years, right? Well, yes. But here we are interested in how much of the outperformance is from the USA’s fundamentals (or perhaps carry) beating the rest of the world versus the USA’s valuations richening versus the rest of the world.


From 1980 to 2020 the USA has outperformed EAFE by 2.1% per annum. A hefty number (though not statistically significant). Now, as you might guess, there have been some changes in absolute and relative valuation over this period. 

We see a giant repricing with the USA getting relatively much more expensive on CAPE and ending effectively at a peak. You know what regression is coming right?


 I regress the difference in annual return (USA minus EAFE) on the contemporaneous difference in annual percentage change in CAPEs over 1980–2020:


USA minus EAFE = 0.4% + 0.94 * change in valuation, R2 = 91.5% (0.7) (19.6)


So, when we adjust for the change in relative valuation, the return differential shrinks from an economically (if not statistically) significant 2.1% per annum to an insignificant (both ways) forty basis points. The victory of the USA over EAFE for the last forty years is almost entirely coming from it getting relatively more expensive.

Basically, if you were estimating long-term expected returns going forward, would you want to build in CAPE appreciation going on forever at the rate in the graph above, or would you remove that effect and look at the intercept? I think the answer is obviously the latter and hope by now you agree! 


This has real implications for asset allocators where the “removing the effects of massive changes in valuation” method argues for much more non-USA exposure than one would get just looking at simple realized returns and assuming they are a fair sample for the future (and this is without assuming any mean reversion from the historic high valuations of USA vs. EAFE). 


Basically, those who’ve changed their portfolio, selling their international stocks and putting it in the USA, because of the 30 years of USA outperformance, are kind of building in the assumption that relative CAPEs, which have gone up 2-3x for the USA vs. EAFE, do so again in perpetuity.

m58453,,investing,post,1615767209,"The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely workedhttps://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later.",['TGT']

m592rq,,investing,post,1615770312,"Equity-Based Dollar-Cost Averaging: Methodically Buying Dips and Taking Profits Anyone who spent some time studying the basics of investing knows about dollar-cost averaging. If anyone needs a refresher, here's a short analysis between lump-sum versus averaging by Vanguard: [https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum).

Vanguard makes a compelling case about market timing. Assuming a retail trader can't time the market (even if you don't support EMH, it still is obvious that this is pretty darn difficult), you may believe it's simply for those who are scared of realizing losses, which is exactly the point they make.

I would like to propose a slight tweak to the concept: instead of spreading the payments out over time, spread them out over price. You start with an initial exposure, and scale up when the market takes a hit, while scaling down to take profits during bull runs.

Let's demonstrate why this works out. Take a random price point the SPY has reached in the past: 250 USD. How many times did it reach this point? Five times. Take another one, 270 USD: **ten times.** How about 290 USD? **Fourteen times.** But maybe that's just a recent trend. Things might've been different back when it was around 100 USD, right? Nope, **ten times it reached 100 USD.**

I haven't conducted an elaborate backtest, but it's clear the amount of setbacks to any particular price level is rather large, just as it's clear the whole thing is positively drifting in general.

Given that we know this, instead of investing 100% at once, consider what would happen if you invested 60% at 100 USD and invested an extra 20% for every 10% drawdown, and scaled down by 5% for every 10% increase? In other words, we scale up by double the drawdown, and realize half of our profits.

Starting in May '68, let's say we started investing with 60 shares for a 6,000 USD position with 4K left in cash. Two months later we hit a low of 88 USD per share, meaning we now own 80 shares at roughly 7,000 USD with a little over 2K in cash. We dip to below 72 in May '70 resulting in 100 shares with 800 USD remaining in cash. We hit four profit targets on the way up to 105 USD and end up with 80 shares and 2.6K in cash for a total of 11K USD. That's already doubling our profits while significantly reducing our exposure at any given time!

We could continue to test and demonstrate this, but the point is clear; we all know this will generate less returns in a very strong bull market, and create very strong opportunities in bear markets. We profit when bull runs are facing continous corrections, when the market goes sideways with some swings in between, and we are extremely well-protected against crashes, able to purchase lows and hold whole multiples of shares compared to when we'd just lump-sum.

It's no coincidence the greats such as Warren Buffet hold so much of their available capital in cash and play the waiting game on crashing markets. Ask yourself: when the markets crashed by 50+% over the course of their history, did it ever correspond with a similar collapse of the global economy? Not really, jobs were lost, consumer spending took a hit, some companies went under, but at a global scale we never took a hit even in the same universe as the rate at which the market tanks during those times.

So what's your take on this? Is this even considered ""dollar-cost averaging""? Are there superior alternatives? Or would you consider / are you already applying this in your actual investment strategies? Would very much like to further my knowledge on this topic.",

m5czmg,,investing,post,1615783643,"$SESN (Sesen Bio) D&D huge incoming catalysts with mayor impact on bladder cancer.
Today I´m bringing you all my third D&D. There will be no technical analyzed information done by me as I´m not good at it but I like to do some information research and maybe you find it helpful. 

*Disclaimer: I´m not even close to being a financial advisor so please do your research and make your own decisions based on what you understand.*

Before you ask, I currently hold 3652 shares at an average cost of 2.32.

**About the company:**

Sesen Bio is a late-stage company developing fusion protein medicines. Their fusion protein approach tethers a tumor-targeting antibody fragment to a protein cytotoxic payload to form a single protein molecule designed to selectively and broadly kill cancer cells while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells and to activating the body’s innate immune response system.

**What are they doing and why I think it´s important:**

The company is initially focused on the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Their main drug is it’s called **Vicineum.** This is being evaluated in the [**Phase 3 VISTA** trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02449239?term=vicinium&rank=1) for the treatment of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have been previously treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is the current standard of care for NMIBC. While BCG is effective in many patients, challenges with tolerability have been observed and many patients will experience recurrence of the disease. If BCG is not effective or a patient can no longer receive BCG, the recommended option for treatment is radical cystectomy, the complete removal of the bladder.

*In case you ask how many people are vaccinated with the BCG feel free to click this link:* [*http://www.bcgatlas.org/*](http://www.bcgatlas.org/)*.*

The preliminary findings are highly encouraging, demonstrating that treatment with Vicineum results in clinically meaningful efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability. In addition, the data are consistent with the results of Vicineum in their completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.

&#x200B;

**Vicineum** can potentially treat **head and neck cancer.** They have completed Phase 1 trials for an injectable form of Vicineum for the treatment of SCCHN that have demonstrated anti-tumor activity and safety. Data from these trials also demonstrated that certain patients who were injected with Vicineum in one tumor had responses in non-injected tumors as well, suggesting that Vicineum may promote an anti-tumor immune response and combine well with immunotherapies. In addition to the Phase 1 trials, Sesen Bio completed a Phase 2 trial in the United States, which demonstrated a reduction in the bidirectional size of the principle targeted tumor observed in 71 percent (10/14) of patients evaluated in the study.

[https://sesenbio.com/our-programs/#bladder-cancer](https://sesenbio.com/our-programs/#bladder-cancer)

**Some important fact about Bladder Cancer:**

\- Bladder cancer is the 6th most common cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. If BCG is not effective one of the options is **complete bladder removal.** Bladder cancer is a highly prevalent cancer, but options for treatment have not changed in more than 20 years. At Sesen Bio, they want to help you save your bladder. **Vicineum**™, is administered in the exact same way as BCG but works differently and may offer a new option.

\- This year, an estimated 83,730 adults (64,280 men and 19,450 women) in the United States will be diagnosed with bladder cancer. Smoking accounts for 47% of all these cases.

\- Bladder cancer mostly affects older people. About 90% of people with bladder cancer are older than 55. The average age people are diagnosed with bladder cancer is 73.

\- The 5-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least 5 years after the cancer is found. Percent means how many out of 100. The general 5-year survival rate for people with bladder cancer is 77%. If the tumor is invasive but has not yet spread outside the bladder, the 5-year survival rate is 69%. Approximately 33% of bladders cancers are diagnosed at this stage.

**Why I´m very bullish and this and analysts are too:**

\- Since 2006 the Oncology Products Reviewed by FDA that have a BLA Submission (as Vicineum has) have a Probability of Approval of 82%.

\- **Forward-looking Timeline for Vicineum**

Positive progress in the US and Europe enables a clear regulatory path forward with the following anticipated milestones:

\- **Potential for Peak Revenue of $1B - $3B Globally for Vicineum**

Substantial US opportunity and OUS potential of roughly two times the US.

An anticipated virtuous cycle of advocacy across physicians, patients/caregivers, and payers to drive rapid uptake and strong growth after approval and launch.

Compelling intent to prescribe research in the US.

A highly concentrated US market of \~1,500 Urologists treating \~75% of BCG patients allows for efficient targeting.

\- **Key partnership with leading partner in MENA (Hikma Pharmaceuticals)**

A public company headquartered in London with a market cap of >$6B and >$2B in annual revenue.

The fifth-largest pharma company in the MENA region trusted and leading licensing partner in the region and extensive regulatory affairs capabilities.

**My opinion on all this:**

Vicineum appears to be the new great thing around bladder cancer, numbers are showing to be great and this is close to receiving an FDA response which is expected to be positive. This is the 6th most common cancer and if the BCG fails the most common treatment is bladder removal. Sesen is trying to avoid this by providing a great solution. The company is partnered around the world to provide this once approved and is aiming beyond the USA. The balance sheet looks impeccable, no debt, 44M free, indicators look great for the short, mid, and long-range with a huge upside on a price target. 

I see this having some big news soon and driving the price very high up. 

Another important thing is that there are not many videos or spam around it so the price isn´t pumped in my opinion. 

There is a BCG shortage which might help Sesen Bio get their drug approved even faster. This shortage has been going for some years now. 

I will not buy more shares as I already own a lot but I see this as a great investment.

Even on really simple cases of a few shares bought a year ago and never traded at any point later, the cost basis is just... wrong?

I'ma 32yo newbie and just received some extra cash. I have opened up a Roth IRA account and contributed 6k for 2020 and 6k for 2021.

I'm looking for suggestions for where to invest it. I want to diversify my portfolio amongst different index funds, ETFs etc.

My goal is to be financially covered once I retire.

I already use Robinhood to invest in singular stocks.

I have done some research and come across some index funds such as a VOO and VTI which look promising. Just looking for some advice and how much to allocate.

I understand risk. But I would consider myself to be comfortable in the  moderate area of risk. My plan is for long term investing. Thx and be Safe",

My wife and I both do the match for work 401ks and have a healthy savings. We also cannot contribute to a Roth. 

What etfs would you suggest. I would say I like moderate risk. Not trying to be conservative, but not trying to buy game stock tomorrow.

What we see in a lot of growing companies is negative earnings, but positive cash flow. I’ve started to think about it recently and it has started to confuse me a bit. How does this get easily explained by “oh they’re a growing company”?.  
  
Thinking about it it would seem that a growing company might have negative cash flows from investing into the future while having positive earnings only taking into account the expenses that go into making what they sell.

# Understanding the eVTOL Space

(Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag)

Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a moo*o* point.

Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off & Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the *same per mile as a ground-based ride share*.

Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check [this article](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/evtol-air-taxi-flying-car-market-players/) to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) *or* are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded [DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lwj8rs/a_world_of_evtols_a_comparison_of/) that I highly recommend checking out.

The United States is acutely aware that it ['missed the boat'](https://www.osinto.com/post/agility-prime-the-pentagon-s-evtol-power-play) on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the [Department of Defense.](https://dod.defense.gov/) Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched **Agility Prime**, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their [website](https://agilityprime.com/index.html?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=AgilityPrime#/) here and highly recommend reading this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-flying-cars-could-take-off-soon-if-we-let-the-military-help/) by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from *the Jetsons.*

The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a **TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM**, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario.

Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at **$1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S**. Joby Aviation cited the [2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/bah-uam-executive-briefing-to-post.pdf) for its forecasts.

Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities:

1. **Batteries!!** \- Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's *ludicrous* mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. [Alakai Skai](https://www.skai.co/)'s (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services
2. **Certification** \- These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause.
3. **Safety** \- To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. *It will be complicated to write software* to reliably control all that, [says Ella Atkins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/02/10/lilium-evtol-spac-air-taxi/?sh=33d80b54627c), an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. *“You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,”* says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone.
4. **Air Traffic Control** \- Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of *skyports/ vertiports* dotted around an urban area.
5. **Public Perception** \- Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, *“*[*lasing*](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws/)*”* of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only.

All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space:

1. **Joby Aviation - $RTP** (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play)
2. **Blade - $EXPC** (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play)

# Outlook for EXPC and RTP

**Blade - EXPC**

[Investor's presentation](https://brs-apartments.flyblade.com/blade/production/uploaded-assets/1608040247.pdf)

* **Blade is an eVTOL index play**, often thought as the *""*[*Uber of skies*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-small-aviation-tech-company-will-turn-into-the-uber-of-the-skies-2021-01-11)*""* operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform.
* **Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable**; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products.
* There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to ***selling shovels in a gold rush.***
* Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. **This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow**.”
* **Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities** that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC<>Blade strategic merger even more prudent).
* **Blade operates in four key lines of business:**
   * *Short Distance* – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders).
   * *BLADE Airport* – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 .
   * *BLADE MediMobility* – **Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States**, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers.
   * *International Joint Ventures* – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. **Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India** flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi.
   * The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo).
* **Blade's projected revenue outlook**:
   * Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million.
   * Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. **This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026**. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then.
   * But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt)
* **Blade's Competitive Moat**:
   * **BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility.**
   * **#1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets**, brings credibility to new market expansion.
   * **Strong management team with domain expertise** and public market experience.
   * **BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies** to generate attractive growth opportunities.
   * Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables **flight volume growth** and **accelerates launch timeline for new markets**
   * While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and **it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost** (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes.
* **ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares**, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares.
* **Leadership:** Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.
* **Board of Directors** upon completion of transaction:
   * Eric Affeldt, Chief Executive Officer of Experience Investment Corp. and previously CEO of publicly-traded ClubCorp
   * Jane Garvey, former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of United Airlines Holdings, Inc.
   * Kenneth Lerer, Managing Partner of Lerer Hippeau, Co-Founder of Huffington Post, and former Director of Viacom, Inc.
   * Susan Lyne, Co-founder and General Partner of BBG Ventures and former President of ABC Entertainment Group, a division of the Walt Disney Company
   * Ted Philip, Lead Independent Director of United Airlines Holdings, Inc. and Lead Independent Director of Hasbro, Inc.
   * **Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade**; Former Chief Financial Officer of Sony Corp. of America, Head of Global Corporate Development, Sony Corporation, and Chief Operating Officer, Warner Music Group
   * David Zaslav, Chief Executive Officer of Discovery, Inc. and Director of Sirius XM Holdings, Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., and Grupo Televisa, S.A.B.
* **Investors - Strategic / Institutional Venture Capital:**
   * **Airbus**
   * Lerer Hippeau
   * Colony Northstar
   * Raine Ventures
* **Investors - Private Venture Capital:**
   * Kenneth Lerer (Board Chairman) – Lerer Hippeau; Co-Founder, Huffington Post
   * David Zaslav – CEO, Discovery Inc.
   * Barry Diller – Chairman, IAC; Former CEO: Fox, Paramount Pictures
   * **Eric Schmidt – Former CEO, Google**
* **Financial Advisors:**
   * Credit Suisse is serving as the exclusive financial and capital markets advisor to Blade.

# What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth

**Blade - EXPC**

* PF shares outstanding: **82.5 million**
* EXPC SP as of 03/14: **$12.9**
* SPAC Cash = $375MM
* 82.5MM \* $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap
* PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash)
* Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is **7.4x.** On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers.
* Unadjusted:
   * 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be **$402MM** (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number).
   * This means that the **unadjusted** **EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales**. That is very low.
   * This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$3.35 billion**.
   * That is **215%** **above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61**
* Adjusted:
   * We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The **present value sales number is $230 million** (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%).
   * As a result, the **adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x** (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million).
   * This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$2.077 billion**.
   * That is **95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2**
* Average between adjusted and unadjusted:
   * Target market value is $2.713 billion.
   * **Fair share price: $32.89**

**Conclusion:** ***EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9*** *(As of 03/14/2021)*

This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement.

**Joby - RTP (Speculation)**

* It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.)
* Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of *saving a billion people an hour a day.*
* Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months.
* Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months.
* ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category.

# How I am playing EXPC and RTP

* Catalysts:
   * ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play
   * EXPC - A lot of spec predictions [floating around](https://mobile.twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1368222379080638467) about the shareholder vote on 3/31
   * Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound.
* Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow.
* I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well.
* Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (>5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting.

**Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor**, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

In other words, I think this space has a lot of potential to become something of a future bubble / hype sector, but also become a very real and profitable space as well. I like the long term potential of EVTOL more than electric cars since I believe there will be far better moats here with a lot less competition. Also has some potential for future crossover with defense industry.

Not saying I would go whole hog on this, but I picked up some warrants as a speculative play on RTX after the SPAC shares crashed back to being close to the initial $10 value.  In my view, the long-term warrants (expire in 2027) present an opportunity for a LOT of upside, where the downside is not necessarily that high.

In other words, I think that ***right now,*** the risk assymetry is heavily skewed to the upside.

That being said, unless WSB catches onto hype in this sector, I'm not sure I would want to play these short term. I would not buy options on these here personally. Overall, I think the macro headwinds to growth stocks is going to be a little bit tough over the next  few quarters. It'll probably help that these are small caps, but I still think these are best viewed as speculative long term call options on a potential new disruptive technology.",['RTX']

Through this latest phase, the company has invested in additional options that allow shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

Schneider has expanded its technology lineup of Schneider FreightPower, first announced mid-year 2020, to help shippers save time and increase their access to capacity. The company rolled out the accompanying app to carriers in Fall 2020.

Through this latest phase, Schneider FreightPower aims to provide shippers with options to manage their businesses right at their fingertips. The digital marketplace allows shippers — big and small— to easily book, track and confirm delivery 24 hours a day seven days a week.

“Our goal is to make Schneider FreightPower the digital access point for services and solutions for both shippers and carriers,” said Mark Rourke, president and CEO of Schneider. “Shippers of all sizes come to us with their toughest transportation challenges, and we are solving them faster than ever before. That means our customers get more value – and get more done in a day.”

Schneider FreightPower offers access to tools such as:Instantly quote and bookFreight visibility 24/7 (load in process, last location, pickup and ETA), including email notifications (pickups, deliveries, and specific order completion)Access to load documentsReal-time reporting


“Schneider FreightPower is an exciting, new way to differentiate Schneider and connect to small shippers and carriers which represent a $1.2 trillion segment of the transportation market,” said Rourke. “We are giving shippers time, solutions and the best at what we deliver— access to full Schneider capabilities and options. It’s all about improving capacity, so shippers can do business better than ever before,” said Rourke.

m5s8un,,investing,post,1615835255,"$IGIC is a sleeper company that is DEEPLY undervalued 

**$IGIC (commons) & $IGICW (warrants)**

* Growing at 31% YoY
* Extremely Moaty Specialty Insurance Business
* Family-owned company (\~29% of outstanding shares)
* No debt
* Not affected negatively by Covid (so not dependent upon reopening)
* Specialized insurance (high profit margins)
* Insurance rates are the highest they've ever been (we're seeing 20-30% gains in premiums)
* Profitable
* 20 Year old business
* Founder still very active in the company (he's 87)
* Pays a dividend
* $380m in cash (their M.C. is $345m CRAZY)
* Repurchasing shares
* Has warrants (they're a 1-1 with an $11.50 Strike)

They mainly write insurance in the Middle East (Jabsheh family is well respected and are a real value add. However they've recently added N.A. and did 30m in premiums last quarter).

**Company History:**

I spoke to IR (investor relations) she said she won't leave the company until she fixes the volume problem. She's the only employee that's worked for a public company, so the old guard is a bit difficult to talk with. The owner is a big baller, he's worth 100m all from the company. Started it 20 years ago, he's 87 and still goes to work everyday. You can set up a investor call with him at 8pm at night (his time), you'll catch him smoking a cigar and drinking scotch. Fucking chad.

**So what's the problem?**

A couple of things... $IGIC went public via a SP4C on March 22nd, 2020. The SPAC offering was at \~$10 the market Armageddon that ensued caused them to drop below $7 and they've traded sideways since then. The original investors (Argo Group being the largest one) would like to exit their position but they are unable to for 2 reasons.

1. Lockup period ends in March, it's any day now that the SP4C lockup ends.
2. They won't sell at a loss. Until this thing moves above $10 you won't see a real marketplace exist for it... This stock needs liquidity and we can provide that to create a real marketplace for it.

**Let's talk fundamentals are valuations...**

These types of business' are valued on their book. Let's take a look at where $IGIC stands relative to it's competitors.

As you can see $IGIC is trading a multiple of .87x price-to-book relative to $KNSL which is 10.15x price-to-book. $IGIC is growing almost as quickly as $KNSL. $IGIC is profitable, in it for the long run, growing quickly, and way underappreciated.

**Conservative PT:** $12 or \~1.5x price-to-book

**PT:** $30 or \~4x price-to-book

**Bullcase PT:** \~$70 or \~10x price-to-book

As you can see this is anywhere from a 2 bagger to a 10 bagger. I am very long $IGIC and am excited for the liquidity and volume issues to be resolved. When this has a real marketplace this stock will move... quickly.

**Positions:**

25,000 commons @ $7.5

10,000 warrants @ $.72",['IR']

m4y0mb,,investing,post,1615738368,"Why I think Mohawk Group Holdings ($MWK) is a Great Long Term Play.Mohawk Group Holdings is a small cap (1B) AI enabled consumer product company.  If you frequent Amazon, chances are you've encountered some of their brands while shopping. Simply put, Mohawk's business model is leveraging their proprietary AI tool ""AIMEE"" to research, develop, market, and manage their 400+ SKUs . Along with making their own products, Mohawk is in the business of consolidating 3rd party sellers on Amazon through acquisitions. Based on their technology's determination of market opportunities present on Amazon, Mohawk decides on whether they can become a market leader in segments by either building the product themselves in 6-8 months (much faster than the typical product development life cycle for larger CPG companies) or acquiring a brand (typically at 2-5x EBITDA) and increasing the contribution margin for all of the brand's products with AIMEE.

Some of their successful brands you can find on Amazon: Healing Solutions, Truweo, hOmelabs, Vremi, Rif6

In a recent interview, CEO Yaniv Sarig also explained that through their integration of AIMEE, they onboard these SKU's supply chains and revenue streams in their system within 24-48 hours of the deal closing (much more efficient than any other CPG like P&G, Unilever, etc.).

To put a cherry on top of everything, Mohawk operates at the moment with **ONLY** 53 employees, yielding around 3.5million per employee in revenue (using 2020 net revenue). In an interview with Sarig he also explains that his vision is to allow for the technology to enable everyone at the company to become ""Super Heros"" and what 1 employee can do with AIMEE, would require 50 employees at a large CPG company.

&#x200B;

Lets look at the financials:

Currently at the price of $35\~ $MWK trades at an attractive 3.13 P/S  with a 50% CAGR since 2017. Mohawk also has improved their gross margins to 45.6% from 39.4% in their latest quarter.

While the CAGR  of revenue is 50%, I believe the revenue growth of the company to be closer to 100%+ growth for next year due to further acquisitions and a recent announcement of potential M&A targets. Direct quote from earnings:

*""We are currently evaluating a strong pipeline of potential M&A targets that in total have trailing twelve month’s net revenue of $522 million and trailing twelve month’s EBITDA of $97 million.""*

These deals which have letters of intent signed are **not** yet included in guidance (which was already raised this quarter) making me even more bullish. Additionally, Mohawk plans to expand to other countries as quick as possible as they have made a recent acquisition in Photo Paper Direct, their first UK based e-commerce move. I believe this expansion to other markets will be a recurring theme with Mohawk in the future.

I believe that at the growth of Mohawk warrants a higher P/S ratio (closer to 6 to 8 P/S like Thrasio, a comparable company). Along with the higher P/S I believe the market is underestimating the potential revenue growth of the company.

&#x200B;

It is important to understand the risks of any business so here they are and my opinions:

1. Mohawk is primarily on Amazon and relies on them
2. Expanding too quickly / Dillution
3. Competitors

For the first point, it is not too much of a concern in my opinion as Amazon also wants their 3rd party sellers to succeed on their platform. You wouldn't want to see Amazon made products in the top search for every product you search for. CEO Yaniv Sarig also discusses this point in the interviews and does not seem too concerned about Amazon interfering with their products.

On the second risk, for any small cap, expanding too quickly can always be a problem, but I do not see this as a major problem for Mohawk since they acquire EBITDA positive brands and have such low overheads with their technology and low human capital. Along with this, I believe that the way they are acquiring companies, they are growing at a much faster pace than their potential dilution.

To the third point, Mohawk's counterpart would be Thrasio which is another innovative CPG company consolidating sellers on ecommerce platforms, valued at 3 billion. I believe that this consolidation of sellers on ecommerce platforms has room for many players and while Thrasio is a competitor, there is room in the market for both since ecommerce has such a large TAM.

Here is a link to their most recent earnings:

It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

m4ghin,,investing,post,1615672644,"Long commodities, short bonds. Protection against inflation, and the house of cards that is the US bond market.Hey everyone,

So basically I think there is a good probability that we are at the edge of an economic disaster. I have been talking about the bond market, and looking into what is going on there and it is clear that the FED has their hands tied on this and our only path forwards are 1) hyperinflation or 2) failure in the bond market due to rising interest rates.

In 2019, the world economy was running hot AF. In just the span of time from 2018-2019 the us median income rose 2%, poverty dropped 2%, and it all seemed very good.

The FED saw that the economy was getting hot, and that their quantitative easing (QE) policy might be becoming less effective. They have some bank tools that are used to combat inflation and interest rates. These tools are IOER, SLR%, and YCC.

IOER: Interest one excessive reserves. This is perhaps the most important tool because feds can manually change the interest rate on the M1 money stock. This is important because from this first money stock, every-time one passes hands there is an interest rate associated with it. So Interest rate on IOER affects the M1 money stock, M2 money stock, all banks, and almost all of the credit that we try to get, it also affects SLR%.

SLR%: Supplementary leverage ratio %. This is basically how much loan loss reserves a banks and companies need to always keep on hand in order to meet the needs of their members. For example, the US fed can put a cap at 10% SLR% and that means that the bank can leverage 90% of its money out, while only keeping 10% on hand. This is influenced by IOER and this SLR% is the main reason we cannot raise interest rates using IOER.

In 2019 we tried raising IOER, which increased SLR. When we did that we moved the underbelly of a beast so massive we had no idea how big it could be. When we raised IOER many banks and companies have taken out so much debt that they literally COULD NOT STAY LIQUID with increases in interest rates.

[https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w](https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w)

Not only did this raise in interest rates lead to a huge liquidity disaster, it also led to liquidity disasters IN OTHER COUNTRIES. That is really really really worrisome. We raise interest in the IOER and all the suddenly Turkey also is having a major fucking liquidity issue. I don't know each country but I do know that our 2019 actions were affecting Turkey and other countries.

So what did we do in response the the 2019 liquidity disasters? WE LOWERED INTEREST RATES AND PRINTED MORE MONEY. WE KEPT THE ZOMBIE GOING.

then the pandemic hit...

The pandemic hit and the FED already knew we were at a knives edge with the bond market. So their plan, although they say it was to help us, was to pump up the zombie economy with a huge monumental stimulus. Then we got two more after.

I wanted this stimulus, we all wanted this stimulus, but by pumping the stimulus in the economy and pumping up these institutions that can't stay liquid if they had high interest rates has kind of put off the inevitable. A huge falling out of people who have too much debt.

So here we are in 2021. Government debt has not improved (it has got worse), credit ratings on many zombie companies that aren't turning a profit are going to get worse and worse credit ratings = high standards of SLR% to stay liquid. This is going to make it even MORE difficult for these companies to deal with high interest rates.

**WHAT DOES THIS FIRST PART MEAN?**

We have tools to deal with inflation, the most important being raised interest rates using (IOER) which influences SLR% and capital requirements of institutions. However, we have so much debt, and so much of this debt belongs to companies that don't turn a significant profit. So we can't raise interest rates if we don't want a flat out crash in the bond market and wave of bankruptcies of major corporations and possibly financial institutions.

so if controlling for inflation by raising IOER would lead to a liquidity crisis in the bond market, how do we control for and prevent hyper inflation?

People have been talking about Yield Curve Control (YCC) as it is a tool to control for inflation. However it is not. YCC works by the FED going into the economy and buying up as many 10y and 30yr bonds as they can (this puts more money in economy), then selling a bunch of their short term expiring bonds. This buying on the long end and selling on the short end would help keep interest rates low for companies to stay liquid, BUT LOW INTEREST RATES LEADS US TO MORE INFLATION, so this plan will not work for very long.

**THE FED IS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE**

**increase IOER to control inflation** = major liquidity issue and a fallout of our bond market

**do YCC to avoid fall out of bond market** = more inflation!

**print more money** i**nject it into the economy** = buy more time but put off inevitable.

I have been thinking about this and I don't see that they have a way out. I have read into it and also heard people talk about this long before I got here. Below I leave some links so you can hear about this from someone else besides me.

[https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w](https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w) (former banker sees same pending disaster)

**Commodities**

I don't want to talk about the inflation we are seeing in commodities because we have talked about steel a shit ton here and all of us know that inflationary signs are all over the economy. CPI will literally be the last indicator that inflation is here SO PLEASE INGORE THE FED WHEN THEY SAY CPI IS LOW.

We see inflationary pressure all over the market. Especially in commodities, producer prices, import costs, housing prices, etc. The FED is only saving face with CPI cause they know controlling inflation means crashing the bond market.

**My Plan**

**Exposed myself to commodities**: I have invested in a handful of commodity tickers $RFP $MT $CLF $LPX $CTT $PCH $SXC, $ADM because even if we have the catalysts of a crazy economic recovery we also have inflation. So no matter what these stocks do, they HAVE to go up. I think in 2021 any commodity stock that can produce cash is a good one to have.

**Expose myself to raising interest rates**: To ensure that I do not end up being a bag holder for the irresponsible lending and money printing that our government has engaged in for the last decade i am buying puts against the bond market. I have bought puts against $TLT $VGSH $HYG $VMBS $VGIT. I will keep buying them too.

**interest rates stay low = more inflation = commodity stocks go up**

**raise interest to control inflation = bond yields go up, prices of bonds go down. potential fallout of companies and institutions that can't meet SLR%**

I took out positions on Monday and its like i touched a beast that just woke up. It should not be possible to be up $1500 in one day. the VGSH puts for october that I got for 10 dollars are now worth like 300.

[https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc](https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc) 

TLDR; If you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy commodities. If you want to protect yourself from the fucking house of cards that is the bond market, buy puts on bond ETF's against the bond market. This strategy might be VERY successful this year. Most of the puts i am buying are for the late fall or early next year.

If this country could handle higher interest rates I think we would be okay. But the 2019 disaster did not spur confidence that we we were in a position then, and now the house of cards has only expanded and our money printing has led to enormous amounts of speculation that this world has never seen. Cryptos, SPACs, NFT's, High valuations, Cathie Wood, Chamath, etc. etc. To make this wore we are already starting to see inflation pressures hit producers and commodities. EU and AU are doing MORE MONEY PRINTING and QE. Money hasn't even started moving through the economy too. We have not even opened up.

I sincerely wish I could believe this administration that we are in for a great economic recovery. They are completely ignoring the huge fucking problem right under their nose.

m4j5zg,,investing,post,1615680574,"Mini-Index Fund Strategy (With Backtested Results)A little while ago I read this article from the WSJ: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-just-one-share-of-stock-is-easier-than-ever-but-should-you-11601825871](https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-just-one-share-of-stock-is-easier-than-ever-but-should-you-11601825871)

The article talks about how since trading fees are so low, and it’s easier than ever to own one share, why not buy shares one at a time. It posed the idea of a mini-index fund that you could make just for yourself. *Rather than buy SPY, just buy one share of each of its components*. I always thought the idea novel when you consider the diseconomies of scale in the asset management industry. So I decided to test out the idea with backtesting.

\-I’ll be testing the mini-index fund strategy with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJI)

\-I’ll be using DIA as the comparable passive instrument.

\-Using QuantConnect as my backtesting environment.

\-To simulate round-trip trading costs, I liquidate holdings at end of all backtests.

\-To further try to simulate real-world conditions, all backtests will have some excess cash, but not too much as if a real person was funding an investment account to buy something they already thought out. For example, if you want to buy one share of DIA at $286.00 you might deposit $300.00 in your account. Or if you need $4873.00 to buy one share of all the constituents of the DJI, you might round off your deposit at $4900.00.

**Limitations/Things I’d try to incorporate if I wanted to explore this more**

\- All buying happened at the start of the backtesting period. A more realistic scenario to mimic small retail investors would be progressive buying as time goes on.

\- Fees are based on the IBKR brokerage model, NOT INCLUDING IBKR LITE. I would like to simulate zero-fee trading, but the trick with that is that I’d have to account for costs associated with the sometimes less than optimal trade execution that is known to occur with “free” brokerages. And those costs are hard to measure.

\- I did not use a price-weighting allocation yet. What I would do next is see how an exact copy of the DIA would perform.

\- My Backtest period is not that long. Less than a year. It starts 8-31-20 because that is the date when the DJI components last changed and ends on 3-13-21. If I wanted to spend some money on a data source that provides constituent information on indices, I could make the backtest period longer. There are ways to get that info without paying, but I’m only an amateur at python.

\- DJA is very limited, I’d rather do this test on the S&P500. Once again, need a clean data source to do that without a whole lot of headaches.

&#x200B;

The Results

[Backtest 1 (Benchmark) - 1 share of DIA](https://imgur.com/WYlJjAt)

Here we have the performance of just one share of DIA. I ran a full backtest on the benchmark because I wanted to see the effects of fees and cash drag on performance. Since we dealing with such low quantities a few dollars from either of those would have a meaningful effect. So the number to beat is 12.5%.

[Backtest 2 - 100 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/aOl8qQ5)

For the first backtest I just want to simply see what adding some scale to the portfolio would do. So instead of 1 share of DIA, we have 100. Sure enough, we got more than a whole percentage point in return. Nothing too surprising. The new number to beat: 13.83%.

[Backtest 3 - 1 share of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/syP1yos)

Now we created a portfolio with simply 1 share of every DJI constituent. Its return is very close to the return from Backtest 1 which was 12.5%. I suspect that if you did this strategy with a zero-commission account you might actually beat the 1-share DIA strategy. By how much, hard to say. However, still would be a losing strategy when compared to 100-shares DIA.

[Backtest 4 - 10 shares of each DJI constituent](https://imgur.com/h2teIea)

Same idea with Backtest 2. I want to see how adding a little scale would change things. Sure enough, performs very closely to Backtest 2 – 100 shares of DIA strategy. Doesn’t beat it, but I suspect it might in a zero-fee environment by just a small amount. Of course, this is also the strategy that requires the most capital to implement just to buy all the pieces. So, it wouldn’t be the most practical strategy for most people.

[Backtest 5 - 1000 shares of DIA](https://imgur.com/lVxwWnp)

Since Backtest 2 performed the best, I wanted to see the effect of even adding more scale, this time with 1000 shares. No doubt we have some diminishing returns. We were able to eke out just 1 basis point for an extra 300k of capital.

**Conclusions:**

Based on what I’m seeing, there doesn’t seem to much of a case for the Mini-Index Fund strategy. You’re still better off with just the proper ETF. Not ready to close the book on this just yet. Given time, I would like to test certain conditions that might have the Mini-Index Fund Strategy win at the end.","['DOW', 'SPGI', 'PGR']"

m4qnp9,,investing,post,1615707348,"AudioEye (AEYE) DD - The digital accessibility SaaS leader# Overview 

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company’s operations in recent years. He’s a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company’s mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye’s current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There’s also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There’s a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don’t see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye’s technology isn’t that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye’s customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

* Institutional ownership sits at about 15-16%.

* Insider ownership and major individual shareholders: 

- David Moradi, including indirect ownership through Sero Capital (Interim-CEO): 3,119,600 shares (29.13% of total shares outstanding)

- Jamil Tahir, including indirect ownership through TurnMark Capital (Board Member): 229,564 shares (2.14% of total shares outstanding)

- Dr. Carr Bettis (Executive Chairman): 155,773 shares (1.45% of total shares outstanding)

- Sachin Barot (CFO): 134,834 shares (1.26% of total shares outstanding)


**- Total % of outstanding shares held by insiders: 35-36%.**

* Short interest is currently 20.28% of the total floating shares

# Earnings

**From the latest earning report:**

* Quarterly net revenue was $5.6 million, up 57% YoY
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $1.9 million, up 58.33% YoY
* Quarterly gross profit margin of 73%, up from 66% YoY
* Quarterly net loss of $3 million, up 114.29% YoY

* Full-year net revenue was $20.50 million, up 90% YoY
* Full-year gross profit margin of 71%, up from 59% YoY
* Full-year net loss of $7.2 million, down 7.69% YoY

* Guidance for full-year 2021 of revenue between $30 to $32 million, representing a 46.34%-56.10% YoY increase over 2020

* Spent $2,134 million of quarterly revenue (38.11% of total) and $4,138 million of full-year revenue (20.19% of total) on Stock Based Compensation expenses, which is the principal cause for the widening quarterly EPS loss and the lackluster full-year 2020 EPS improvement.

* Spent $430,000 of quarterly revenue (7.68% of total) and $1.230 million of full-year revenue (6% of total) on Research and Development expenses, which is unusually low for a SaaS company (specially one with AI and machine learning components).

# Balance Sheet

* $9,095 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
* $14,631 Million of Total Current Assets
* **$18,254 Million of Total Assets**

* $9,015 Million of Current Liabilities (including $6,328 Million of Deferred Revenue)
* $1,083 Million of Long-Term Debt
* **$10,620 Million of Total Liabilities**

# Valuation metrics

* Market cap: $305.10 Million
* Total shares outstanding: 10.71 Million
* **PE Ratio: N/A**
* P/S Ratio: 14.88
* P/B Ratio: 39.98
* D/E Ratio: 0.17
* **Negative Free Cash Flow (estimated): ($3.5-4 Million)**
* **PEG Ratio: ≈ N/A**

# Principal financial metrics of closest competitor (all competitors are private companies, so I’m comparing it to a smaller-cap, more mature SaaS just for reference. AudioEye should, ideally, achieve gross margins on the level of PagerDuty at some point):

**NYSE: PD**

* Market Cap: $3.461 Billion
* Revenue: $210 Million
* Gross profit margin: 86.20%
* PS Ratio: 16.48

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It’s a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.
7. Encouraging recent hires of talent from Facebook and Pinterest.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It’s dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It’s urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There’s also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I’m cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position. I truly believe the market opportunity and projected growth for the industry they’re in is insane, but there are several fundamental risks and challenges with the company that need to be acknowledged. Current valuation is probably fair, but not a bargain. Invest at your own caution and discretion.","['PH', 'FB', 'PEG', 'CARR', 'ORCL']"

1. The equity raise at the top implies they have no qualms selling overpriced shares to people.

**Who is Ping An Good Doctor?**

Established in 2014 and listed on the Hong King Stock Exchange in April 2018 **Ping An Good Doctor**, formerly known as **Ping An Healthcare and Technology,** is a health care software company. The Company offers a mobile platform for online consultations, hospital referrals and appointments, health management, and wellness interaction services. In addition, it connects individual consumers with health care resources. Ping An Healthcare and Technology is headquartered in Shanghai, China. Its parent company Ping An is the world largest insurance company in terms of assets and market capitalization

**What is the growth potential of the Digital Health market?**

The global Digital Health market is expected to witness a 37.1% spike in growth in the year 2021 and [thereafter will continue to grow and reach US$508.8 billion by the year 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/25/2133473/0/en/Global-Digital-Health-Market-Report-2020-Market-is-Expected-to-Witness-a-37-1-Spike-in-Growth-in-2021-and-will-Continue-to-Grow-and-Reach-US-508-8-Billion-by-2027.html), trailing a post COVID-19 CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 18.8% over the analysis period 2020 through 2027. Non-COVID-19 healthcare has massively migrated to digital platforms in 2020. From telemedicine to remote patient monitoring & management, new service delivery platforms have been adopted at lightning speeds.

The global telemedicine market size was estimated at USD 55.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a [CAGR of 22.4% from 2021 to 2028.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/telemedicine-industry) The market holds many opportunities to grow during the forecast period owing to the lack of access to care and rising provider adoption of telemedicine, rising consumer demand and patient acceptance, and enhanced quality of care. 

Especially in China the sharp growth for the online healthcare sector is expected to continue in the following years. [Ping An Healthcare has quoted industry](http://www.pagd.net/media/pdf/us/2020an/2020_AN_US.PDF) estimates in its FY 2020 results presentation slides, which suggest that the penetration rate of online medical services in China could potentially expand from 5% in 2020 to 16% in 2025. This implies that Ping An Healthcare's online medical services business has a long growth runway ahead.

**Why Ping An Good Doctor?**
**Rapid User Growth** 

The company [grew rapidly in 2020](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF). As of December 31, 2020 Ping An Good Doctor had 373 million registered users (+18% YoY), 72.62 million Monthly Active Users (+8.5% YoY), 3.98 million monthly paying users (+34.1% YoY) and average daily consultations reaching 903,000 (+23.9 YoY) with network coverage including 3,700+ hospitals and 151,000 collaborated pharmacy outlets in 379 cities in 32 provinces. 

**Good Financial results in 2020**

Ping An Good Doctors[financial performance was good](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF) last year with strong top line growth, improved profitability at the gross margin level, and narrowing losses.

The company's revenue increased by +36% YoY from RMB5,065 million in FY 2019 to RMB6,866 million in FY 2020. In terms of profitability, Ping An Healthcare's gross profit margin expanded by +410 basis points from 23.1% in FY 2019 to 27.2% in FY 2020. Furthermore, Ping An Good Doctor\`s net loss adjusted for share option expenses and foreign exchange, was reduced from -RMB695 million in FY 2019 to -RMB516 million in FY 2020.

**Who is the competition?**

This puts Ping An Healthcare as one of the three major Chinese internet healthcare companies alongside Alibaba Health Information Technology Limited (OTCPK:ALBHF) \[241:HK\] and JD Health International Inc (OTCPK:JDHIF) (OTCPK:JDHIY) \[6688:HK\]. Chinese insurance giant Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. (OTCPK:PNGAY) (OTCPK:PIAIF) \[2318:HK\] is Ping An Healthcare's parent with a 38.4% equity interest, while Alibaba Health Information Technology and JD Health are backed by Alibaba Group (BABA) and JD.com (JD), respectively.

**Ping An Good Doctor profits more from the digital health market than its competitor.** [23 %](http://www.pagd.net/media/pdf/us/2020an/2020_AN_US.PDF) of Ping An Good Doctors revenue came from its online medical services segment (compared to 17% in 2019) and 47% of its Gross profit (+15 pps YoY) In contrast, Alibaba Health generated approximately [97%](https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/alihealth/interim/2021/int.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of the company's 1H FY 2021 (YE March 31) revenue from pharmaceutical direct sales & e-commerce businesses, while sales for the pharmaceutical retail business (including direct and third-party platform) represented [94%](https://files.services/files/586/2020/1126/20201126070002_75568423_en.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of JD Health's 1H 2020 revenue.

In other words, Ping An Good Doctor\`s is a better proxy for the growth of online medical services in China, while Alibaba Health and JD Health are seen as plays on the country's pharmaceutical retail industry.

Notably, Ping An Good Doctor\`s online medical services business segment saw +82% YoY revenue growth last year, which was much higher than the company's overall top line growth and the sales growth of its other business segments. This validates my view with regards to the growth potential of the online medical services industry in China.

It is also noteworthy that the company's online medical services business led the improvement in gross profitability. The gross profit margin of Ping An Healthcare's online medical services improved by +12.0 percentage points YoY to [56.2%](https://staticpacific.blob.core.windows.net/press-releases-attachments/1280120/HKEX-EPS_20210202_9610463_0.PDF) last year.

A favorable revenue mix with an increased sales contribution from higher-margin online medical services drove Ping An Healthcare's overall gross profit margin expansion in FY 2020. In comparison, the company's health management & wellness interaction segment saw YoY declines in gross margin in FY 2020.

**What are the risks?**

**Chinese market as a risk**

While investing in Chinese companies you must keep in mind that even tough the state leaves many companies alone, provided they don´t get involved in politics, the recently cancelled IPO of Ant Financial serves as a reminder that the government can do whatever it wants. Changes in regulatory policies could be negative for Chinese internet health care player. 

Also, Chinese companies saw some red days recently due to speculation that the government might now be able to maintain such high levels of Covid stimulus. But this would only have a short-term effect on the stock. 

**Market risks**

Certain challenges faced by this industry are resistance in technology acceptance by practitioners and patients, high cost of implementation, and data privacy and safety issues. These factors may hamper the accelerating growth to a certain extent. 

**Company risks**

Even though Ping An Good Doctor grew rapidly over the last year it’s never been profitable. This is expected to change within the next couple of years but a longer-than-expected time for the company as a whole and its online medical services business to be profitable poses a risk.

**Is it a good time to buy now?** 

After ARK Investments Management revealed that the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF initiated a new position in Ping An Good Doctor, a $ 3 Billion price surge was sparked but short lived. Right now the price is back to normal and Cathie bought 1 Million more shares on Thursday. As this being a longterm investment I don’t think that there is a need to rush in the stock. I believe it\`s at its fair value at the moment and something to keep an eye on and on the Watchlist.

&#x200B;

If you are not familiar with the company, they are an Australia-based online custom print-on-demand marketplace, (selling to the US and UK/EU predominantly), which in my opinion was very well positioned at the beginning of the pandemic, which gave it even more momentum forward.

I personally use them both as a customer and as a seller and am well impressed with both the seller interface and the quality of the goods. I got super interested now that the company posted their half-year report (apparently they don't do quarterlies at ASX) , which is the best in their history. +96% revenue growth, pre-tax profit up 118%, went long after I read it and the price dropped

Also there seem to be some pretty strong things going for them. My favourite: the CEO buys shitloads of shares and the company will be added to S&P ASX 300

Here are my views on Redbubble

PROS:

* ZERO debt - £130m cash balance
* 36% insider ownership (before CEO purchase)
* CEO spends 2 million AUD to buy shares after Feb earnings report (1.6m on loan, 400k out of pocket)
* Record braking HY report, all I see is growth and potential
* Operating expenses only up 23% vs 96% revenue growth, so they are becoming more efficient
* Massive affiliate marketing that seems to have traction // I DO mean massive if you search for passive income on Youtube, I bet some of the top hits will tell you to sell on Redbubble
* Actually making profit // first year of profit posted in the report, 42m vs -2m
* good market interface for both sellers and buyers // with good quality merchandise
* great customer experience and reviews
* Still relatively small 1.6B cap, a lot of room for growth IMO
* CEO said they won't pay dividends but reinvest everything for growth

CONS:

* Price of stock grew significantly since the 2020 bottom
* You might be exposed to multiple currencies - Their base is in AUD but predominantly sell in USD,GBP,EUR
* Price slid after the earnings report and positive outlook from CEO (WTF?), maybe anticipation was even higher?
* Trades @ ASX so might not be accessible for everyone. Market sentiment might also be different

Morgan Stanley had been quietly buying up 5% for a Japanese bank from October to mid-Feb. Not sure if this has any significance

m4dnp3,gr19ic9,investing,comment,1615829944,"Here are my major concerns with Redbubble.

\-It's a copyright disaster waiting to happen. Independent artists constantly have their design / brands ripped with bootleg merch. While these people have limited ability to fight against Redbubble (removing designs is a hassle, commission is already in the pocket of the thief, and many artists don't even know that their designs are up on the site), seeing that anybody from anywhere can upload any design, lawsuits from big brands is inevitable. Most of the designs that Redbubble recommends are recognizable logos, characters, movies, etc (namely from Disney).

\-Way too much competition. The influx of on demand printing is a huge issue for Redbubble, as it has nothing to differentiate itself from the other sites. It isn't cheaper than competitors, it doesn't have better quality products, but it is quick and easy. 

\-New artists and bots will flood the market with designs. While this doesn't negatively impact Redbubble directly, quantity will go up and quality will go down. Many artists have a hard time beating the recommended algorithm already, and have to rely solely on outside traffic. Not to mention the site's review system is flawed by having reviews being delegated to products rather than designs. This isn't healthy for an ecosystem of artists. 

&#x200B;

I do think on demand products / printing is the way of the future, but I don't have much faith in Redbubble specifically. It's just one of the many average options (except this one will be sued into oblivion if it gains steam).",

**Excerpt:** The economy did collapse back then, but the government did not blow its brains out on fiscal largesse. So, we went into the 1920s with tremendous pent-up demand once the crisis ended, and balance sheets were in far greater shape. Government debt-to-GDP was 10 per cent — not over 100%. And that better public sector balance sheet allowed the federal government to CUT taxes by the mid-1920s — top marginal rates for corporations were initially raised from 10 per cent in 1920 to 13.5 per cent by 1926 but cut to 11 per cent by the end of the decade; for individuals, the rate went from 58 per cent after the war to 24 per cent by 1929. Does anyone think taxes are going to be coming down in the US any time soon?

**Tl;dr:** There are major differences between the end of this pandemic and the end of the Spanish flu, notably business productivity, capital allocation, tax rates, starting valuations of the stock market, demographics and especially government debt levels. We are unlikely to see a repeat of the roaring 20s this decade.

I'm not prone to being particularly for or against, but this is starting to look more like snake oil to me, despite making money off of it in the past directly or indirectly. Please understand I'm looking for alternative perspectives, and thank you in advance.

It doesn't seem to represent a good value store, to which it's proponents then turn around and say, it doesn't matter, its not that! Nor does it permit trading like a currency, given its sometimes wild volatility (how much am I paying for that pizza anyway), to which it's proponents again reassure me, don't worry, it's not that! Lastly, the hedge against a falling dollar/failing monetary policy argument - I don't see how a system to replace a fiat currency but which radically benefits original holders, meanwhile removing some of the variability of economic policy available today will be beneficial, and I can already foresee the argument of - oh but 'the man' devalues our dollar with monetary policy right now as he sees fit, but so too does the volatility of the asset as it trades.

So if it's none of them, what exactly is it we are after and speculating on? To me it seems we are saying that we value the asset for the anonymity as a vehicle of transfer between two people and the ultimate conversion (and valuation versus) a fiat currency that it brings, and perhaps the 'trust' we have all along the chain. I don't think we can go as far as stating it is quicker or more efficient than existing payment mechanisms.

In so far as the current price, I'm not uncertain it's not wild speculation albeit some rather clever friends are completely certain of its future, meanwhile I'm not sure whether they are transfixed and mislead or smart and ahead.",

m43dkq,gqtdid8,investing,comment,1615656261,"Trying to learn how to adult and I want to thank everyone for their advice in advance.  My wife and I live in the US, are 36 years of age, have one child with a combined gross income of $220,000.  We both max out our 401K to the IRS maximum, have three months savings in a high yield savings account and just recently paid off all our debt except for our home which is at 2.875%.  After overhead and saving for our son's college fund, we have a few grand left over every month.  

We recently opened up a brokerage account which we put these surplus funds into so it does something other than looking for fun things that we don't need.  If we decide to travel or need to make a ""major"" purchase our plan is not to dip into these funds but rather not contribute for X months.  

Depending on how things go, we may use these funds to purchase a second home (rental) however if the market tanks, we just won't do that.  As such, we believe our risk tolerance is pretty high.

Right now our portfolio consists primarily of VOO (80%) with a little of QQQ (6%), DIS (6%) and ARKK (2%).  The last 6% are what we consider our fun picks (AMC, CNBS, RBLX).

Our plan is to keep this strategy, depositing surplus every month, into our brokerage account with 80% of it being VOO or QQQ and the last 20% between DIS (my wife's pick), ARKK or other stocks/ETFs that we might think are worth putting money in.

As someone that has been doing this for approximately 9 months, I am looking for any feedback that you may have.  

Again, thank you in advance for your advice.","['DIS', 'ARKK']"
m43dkq,gqsyefi,investing,comment,1615648120,"So I’ve been thinking a lot about dividend vs growth investing and I think I’ve come to settle on dividend investing as the superior option. 

My reasoning is that even during periods of economic stagnation or even decline, that you’re still getting that dividend. Sure, it may be cut a bit, but you’re actively getting “gains” when the market isn’t going up. Isn’t this preferable to a situation where with growth stocks you will see absolutely no return, even losses, during the same periods? 

Another reason is that if you lose your job, you can redirect your dividends to your checking account and live off of that without needing to sell any of your base capital. 

To me dividend investing seems like the better risk management move as you are better off in stagnant or declining periods.",

**$LYTS - LSI Industries Inc. - Ever Been to a Gas Station - Bullish**

**What do they do**

* Based in Cleveland, OH, LSI makes industrial and outdoor lighting systems and accessories. These systems include gas station lighting and display/control systems (touch screens); outdoor sports lighting; and retail lighting systems.
* All products are made in the US which is an important moat for those sectors that require a Made in America designation such as federal contracts.
* The company was founded in 1976 and has grown through acquisitions to offer a broad and complete range of products and services for illumination and branding. As infrastructure spending increases and new developments flourish, both direct uses in retail and sports spaces and ancillary uses in gas stations/road stops will bolster LSI’s business.

**Why is it a good company**

* Improved margins last four quarters
* Doubled ROA and ROE YoY
* High OCF to Earnings ratio; real cash, not accounting
* Earnings growth QoQ; 100% increase YoY
* Decreased debt last eight quarters; debt coverage increased YoY
* Book equity has increased eight straight quarters.
* Enterprise value is less than the market cap

**Why is it a good stock**

* Greater than 90% free float; largest owner at \~8.5%
* Second quartile for momentum/price change: it’s rising but not topping at the moment
* Higher div yield than peers; in line with SPY
* 3 year smoothed FCF yield is 11.5% > WACC: good value looking at a longer time horizon
* P/B lower than peers with better fundamental improvement compared to peers

**What now**

* Long $LYTS with a PT of 12.5; EV/FCF based at 16x T12 FCF
* Write July calls at 12.50, IV = 48% on the bid

**What are you not telling me**

* Pretty low volume: 90 day average = 106k
* New management in the last 3 years might not have navigated the company through a full market cycle
* A slow down in infrastructure spending would negatively impact their profitability

*Data from company website, Refinitiv, and Yahoo! Finance*",

m477a4,,investing,post,1615645263,"MeaTech, first publicly traded cultivated meat company, just launched $25 Million IPOFigured this was worth posting for anyone interested in the future of traditional meat alternatives:

[MeaTech Announces $25 Million US Initial Public Offering & Approval For Nasdaq Listing](https://vegconomist.com/trade/meatech-announces-25-million-us-initial-public-offering-approval-for-nasdaq-listing/)

First publicly traded company in this sector, they're using 3D printing technology to create high-end cultured meats such as steak. They create their own cells and meat tissue for this process. In December they acquired Piece of Meat, a cultured fat technology company, and said their first product could be on the market as early as 2022.

I see huge growth in this sector over the next few years. We've all heard about lab grown meat, usually in jest from news stories making light of it. But as years pass it's becoming increasingly clear that this is going to be a real and expansive market. Reports about the environmental urgency created by animal agriculture continue to pile up, and plant-based options have exploded in popularity over the past few years as well - but are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Products like this will be key in filling that gap and transitioning our food system away from current conventional models, by providing options to those not interested in plant-based alternatives. Cultivating meat also opens up a massive door in the future to addressing food scarcity issues.

MeaTech however launched to very little fanfare. Here's some info [ripped from Seeking Alpha:](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3672241-lab-grown-meat-company-meatech-3d-to-open-on-nasdaq-after-mixed-ipo#comments)

* Lab-grown meat firm MeaTech 3D (MITC) sank as much as 23.8% in its first trading day following a U.S. IPO as investors found the Israeli start-up’s stock less than appetizing.
* MeaTech fell to as low as $7.85 in early Nasdaq trading, way down from its $10.30 initial public offering. Shares beefed up some later in the session, but closed at $10 a share, down 2.9% lower on the day.
* MeaTech had a mixed IPO that saw it sell more American Depositary Shares than expected, but at a weak $10.30-a-share price.
* On one hand, the company sold 2.4M ADSs, well above the 1.7M that it originally offered. However, the company had originally expected to sell shares at $15.10 apiece.
* Still, the combination of more shares at a lower price meant the IPO raised about $25M, which was MeaTech’s original target.
* The firm also granted underwriters the option to buy 364,000 additional ADSs for overallotments.
* Each ADS represents 10 ordinary shares in the company, which already trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the ticker “MEAT” and U.S. OTC market as “MTTCF.”
* MEAT fell 5.8% in Tel Aviv on Thursday ahead of the U.S. IPO, while MTTCF lost 17.2% Friday to close at $1.20. That took the company’s market cap down to about $97.2M.
* MeaTech is developing three-dimensional printers and the biotechnology and manufacturing processes needed to assemble lab-grown proteins into meat “without the need for animal slaughter,” as per its S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
* The company also wrote in the filing that unlike rivals who are trying to develop “unstructured” lab-grown meat products like sausages, MeaTech aims to create “high-margin, high-value structured and cultured meat products such as steak.”

And here's a [bit of DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/greeninvestor/comments/m1yv2o/meatech_3d_ipo_will_this_3d_meat_printer_also/) from u/birdweiser2 as well:
>PROS

>First 3d meat printer (lab grown meat) listed on a major US exchange. The market likes cleantech, 3d printers, and stocks that are unique.

>The founder (Sharon Fima) worked for Nanodimension. Should be enough for Cathie Wood fanboys. It could maybe get added to ARKK - who knows - but people are gonna think it will.

>Bill Gates said rich companies shouldn't be eating meat. Gates is invested in Memphis Meats which does something really similar to what MeaTech does, but isn’t a public company. Memphis raised in 2019 which put the valuation at 2 billion, then raised again a couple months ago, but none of the articles I saw gave a valuation on that raise. Can anyone shine some light on that?

>CONS

>This company has no revenue and says it won’t for a while. So it’s basically a SPAC lol, but at a fraction of the price since they’re mostly all a billion and higher.

>There’s a lot of competitors in this space, but again this is the first to list and it’s at least 10x cheaper than the biggest competitor.

>Their meat products will be expensive when they do go on sale, but I think rich people will want them still. Kinda like how Tesla started - their cars were expensive for a long time, rich people bought them, it helped grow the company, and now they’re cheaper.


While this clearly won't see instant explosive growth like Beyond Meat did (an established brand that had been on the market for years), I entered a small position to keep an eye on this sector.

Basically I heard about the importance of the bond yield rate recently and it sounded quite important. Then I heard about the auction happening on Wednesday and that sounded like it could have consequences, good or bad. From what I understand, the auction was able to sell bonds and thus the yield rate didn’t raise much at all. Then I was like “ok cool that’s over with.” 

But today I am on my yahoo finance app and just happen to see TNX as one of the suggested/trending/whatever items. TNX is the 10 year treasury indicator (idk if it’s a stock or a index or what). And I see that it’s at 1.626 which is higher than it closed at from the auction on Wednesday (1.52 or something). So why did it jump up again? I thought it was supposed to be steady after the auction on Wednesday kind of set things in place. Does it matter really?",

I originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting auto-removed. Let me know if you would like any sources.

# History of Nokia

If you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: ""Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!""

While yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.

**2000-2013**

Nokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.

**2013-2019**

When Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.

This did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started ""trading sideways"" due to a bearish sentiment.

Some investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.

**2020-Present**

In March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.

The bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.

This was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.

Then it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.

**Q4 Earnings Call**

So what exactly did happen during that earnings call on 2/4/21? Why did it hurt NOK's price?

A lot of people blame Pekka messing up the call with some pessimistic word choices, most notably the word ""challenging."" Why would he say this?

It may just be his straight forward personality. It might have been an intentional sandbag so he can control future expectations. It may because Nokia prides itself on being on ethical company. I think it was probably due to a little bit of all of the above. Pekka using this language was not surprising. He said the exact same thing during the 2020 Q3 earnings call.

So the rumors that Nokia may blow it out of the water during their Q4 earnings were unwarranted. Nokia did beat their expected earnings, but because of a decrease in year over year revenue, people overreacted (just like they did when Samsung won the Verizon deal) and sold their Nokia positions.

**Pekka's Tenure**

Pekka has been in charge for 7 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.

* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.
* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.
* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).
* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).
* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.
* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)
* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.
* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to ""Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend"".
   * "" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions""

# Bullish

Here is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.

**Largescale Network**

* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal
* 7 year Belgium deal
* Deutsche Telekom in Germany
* France's Mainland 5G Network
* 5G Network in Austria
* Telecom Italia
* Cibicom ISP in Denmark
* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland
* Telenor Group in Thailand
* Ooredoo in Algeria
* 5G Network in Philippines
* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
* Ecuador
* Vodafone in Australia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore

**Private 5G Deals**

* San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric Private Network
* Port of Seattle
* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp
* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil
* Elisa in Finland
* Optus Stadium in Australia

**Partnerships**

* Google Cloud
* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project
* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;D Center
* AT&amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN
* Patents deal with Samsung
* LG Uplus trial in South Korea

**5G is the Future**

The confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. 

* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.
* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.
   * In it, he admits ""\[5G\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract."" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.
   * ""Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.""
* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.
* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.
* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.
* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.

**Upcoming Events/Rumors**

* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**
   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;D decisions.
* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**
   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day
* **Dividend Reinstatement**
   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.
* **Share Buyback**
   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.

# Bearish (Risks/Cons)

* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.
* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.
* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.
* FCF is used solely for R&amp;amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.
* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.
* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.
* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.
* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.
* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.","['GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'AMP']"

m3qhl9,,investing,post,1615581269,"Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics to Commercialize Canada’s First Automated Heavy Duty Trucking TechnologyCanadian National retailer Canadian Tire Corporation and Toronto based start-up NuPort Robotics Inc., Canada's first autonomous trucking company, have announced a partnership with the Ontario government to invest $3 million to undertake an automated heavy duty trucking project to test a first-of-its-kind-in-the-world technology.

The breakthrough technology provides a transportation solution for the middle mile, the short-haul shuttle runs that semi-tractor trailers make between distribution centres, warehouses and terminals each day. It is designed to enable next-generation automated trucks that are more fuel efficient, safer to operate, and provide an enhanced driver experience.

Backed by $1 million in support from the Ontario government through Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and matched by $1 million investments from Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics, respectively, the two-year project is applying proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI) technology from NuPort Robotics to retrofit two conventional semi-tractor trailers - which will always be attended by a driver - with high-tech sensors and controls, a touchscreen navigation system, and other advanced features such as obstacle and collision avoidance.

""Ontario is proud to be a global leader in automated and connected vehicle technology and this innovative project is an exciting milestone toward automated vehicle tech in the trucking industry,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Ontarians rely on goods being delivered by trucks across the province every day and projects like this are demonstrating the ways that automated truck technology could help businesses meet delivery demands more efficiently while supporting a strong supply chain in Ontario.""

""This project applies unique and made-in-Ontario Artificial Intelligence technology that offers increased safety and efficiency, with a reduced carbon footprint, to the goods supply chains on which we all rely,"" said Vic Fedeli, Ontario Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This is the latest example of how Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network acts as a catalyst, fostering partnerships between ambitious technology start-ups and industry to develop and commercialize next generation transportation technologies that strengthen our economy and benefit society.""

""The trucks are currently transporting goods between a Canadian Tire distribution centre in the Greater Toronto Area and nearby rail terminals within a 12.5 mile radius, and early results are promising"" said Raghavender Sahdev, CEO of NuPort Robotics. ""The aim of the project is to develop a system that incorporates an autopilot feature for conventional trucks with a driver, leading to the most efficient way to drive and increase safety. The sensors work as a ‘safety cocoon' to cover blind spots and prevent accidents and the end result is peak fuel efficiency, meaning lower carbon emissions, and peak driving performance for an overall more optimal transportation experience.""

NuPort Robotic's approach to autonomous trucking is unique in the industry because it focuses only on solving the middle mile challenge, using a known set of predetermined trucking routes that are repetitive and high frequency as opposed to general highway driving. Ultimately, when implemented on fixed routes in the future, Canadian Tire will benefit from faster commercial deployments and improvements in supply chain sustainability.

""Canadian Tire embraces innovation and is always testing new technologies to improve our operational efficiency and safety. As proud Canadian companies, the safety of all stakeholders, including drivers, employees, customers, and public will be the top priority as we work together towards deployment of this technology,"" said Gary Fast, Vice-President of Transportation, Canadian Tire.

""Over the last three years, Canadian Tire has made a significant effort to solve complex business problems by using the Canadian start-up Artificial Intelligence ecosystem, and NuPort Robotics exemplifies what we look for in a start-up with a focus on innovation, automation and artificial intelligence,"" added Cari Covent, Vice President of Intelligent Automation, Canadian Tire.

""As NuPort Robotics continues to develop new technologies to overcome middle mile supply chain problems and advance autonomous trucking, I am extremely grateful for the support of the Ontario Government through AVIN and the Ontario Centre of Innovation. With their continued support, we are striving to position Canada as the leader in autonomous transportation,"" Sahdev said.

m3hspu,,investing,post,1615556581,"$DARE Biosciences and the Month of MarchHey everyone. I wanted to preface this post by saying this is my first DD, so any critiques or feedback is appreciated! I currently own 0 shares in this stock, but it is something that I am purchasing tomorrow morning.

**What is** **Daré** **Bio?**

Daré Bioscience is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the advancement of innovative products for women’s health. The company’s mission is to identify, develop and bring to market a diverse portfolio of differentiated therapies that expand treatment options, improve outcomes and facilitate convenience for women, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health, and fertility.

**Why this stock hit my radar/why you should care:**

Daré just recently announced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial of a one-time treatment for bacterial vaginosis. The treatment, DARE-BV1, received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this year and, based on the topline results of the trial, Daré said it planned to file a new drug application in the first half of 2021. This has further attracted analysts and larger investors to keep their eyes on Daré in the upcoming months as it could be used massively later in 2021.

The condition affects approximately 21 million women in the United States, usually in their reproductive years, [according to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bacterial-vaginosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352279). The condition, which generally doesn’t cause complications, can, however, lead to preterm birth or increase the risk of infertility due to infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes.

**Products in the Pipeline: (Information here is quoted directly from the company's website)**

***Ovaprene*** **(CURRENTLY OBSERVING DATA FROM PHASE 3)**

Ovaprene is a hormone-free, monthly vaginal contraceptive designed to provide contraception over multiple weeks by releasing a locally acting agent which impedes sperm motility, coupled with a unique knitted polymer barrier that physically blocks sperm from entering the cervical canal. The novel combination of these complementary approaches has the potential to produce efficacy consistent with existing short-acting hormone birth control options (pills, patches, vaginal ring), without the use of hormones.

In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.

**NOTES FOR THIS ONE:**

THIS PRODUCT IS HUGE IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL. I cannot express how many women struggle due to contraceptives altering their hormones. Birth control medications ranging from pills to IUDS alter women's hormones causing a laundry list of issues such as weight gain, health complications, and mental illness (depression, anxiety, etc.). If this product is successful, it will be the FIRST in women's contraception to create a product like this that can be administered monthly for women. There is only one other product that really exists that women can use for hormone-free contraception, and that is a specific type of an IUD. HOWEVER, IUDs are EXTREMELY painful, and I am sure many women will prefer Ovaprene as it is additionally self-administered.

***SILDENAFIL CREAM*** **(CURRENTLY IN PHASE 2b CLINICAL TRIALS)**

Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is the inability to reach or maintain a sufficient physical response to sexual stimulation. An estimated 16% of women ages 21 to 60, or approximately 10 million women in the U.S., are distressed from experiencing symptoms of low or no sexual arousal and are seeking a solution to improve their condition. To put the market opportunity for an FDA-approved FSAD treatment in context, the prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction (ED) in men is estimated to be about 5% of men at age 40, increasing to about 15% at age 70.

Still, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for FSAD. Orally administered sildenafil received FDA approval in 1998 for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men and is marketed under the brand name Viagra®. Given the underlying pathophysiologic similarities of ED and FSAD, using sildenafil to direct blood to the genitals before sexual activity could provide a potential improvement in genital arousal response and overall sexual experience for women as it does in men.

Our localized, proprietary formulation of sildenafil cream, 3.6% (topical cream, sildenafil), has been designed specifically for women. The targeted application of this cream to the genital tissue is designed to increase local blood flow without the associated systemic exposure and side effects, leading to an improvement in overall sexual experience and response.

***DARE-BV1*** **(SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED PHASE 3 TRIALS WITH POSITIVE RESULTS)**

Bacterial vaginosis is the most common type of vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. In the U.S. alone, bacterial vaginosis is estimated to affect approximately 21 million women. While there are several orally and vaginally delivered therapeutic interventions indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, currently approved options in the U.S. have relatively insufficient clinical cure rates, require sequential daily administrations or can be otherwise inconvenient for women to use.

DARE-BV1 is a thermosetting vaginal gel formulated with clindamycin phosphate 2% designed for prolonged, localized release of the antibiotic.

**Upcoming Products:**

I'm going to be quite honest here, there are a TON of diverse products that this company is currently working on to counter sexual disorders and health complications involving sexual activity. They are additionally looking into contraceptives for Males as well. This company currently has many of these products in the pre-trials stage, but they are committed to continuing research for the benefit of people's health.

**Previous Drop in Price:**

One thing I think many people will look at and question is the 5-year chart for Daré; this stock used to trade at $33/share back in 2017. However, after the acquisition of another company known as Cerulean, Daré conducted a 10 to 1 reverse split which I think additionally scared off investors. Not to mention, COVID additionally further spiked the price down along with other stocks in 2020 as well.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

&#x200B;

1. On March 25th, Dare will announce their Q4 earnings (pre-market). Based on their positive phrase 3 clinical results, this is predicted to be a positive earnings call with further products hopefully entering phase 3 trials soon.
2. Dare is further participating in two upcoming conferences to debut their products to large investors.

&#x200B;

* Conference #1: **33rd Annual Roth Conference (March 15th)** \[This is the same conference that companies like *Assertio* will be presenting at.\]
* Conference #2: **M Vest and Maxim Group Inaugural Emerging Growth Virtual Conference (March 17 & 18)**
* Conference #3: **BIO-Europe Spring Digital (March 22 - 25)**

1. **Results for clinical trials on Ovaprene.**

&#x200B;

* \*\*Ovaprene is currently in the process to enter clinical trials which are already looking successful. The following is quoted from the DARE website: ""\*\*In a postcoital test (PCT) study, Ovaprene successfully immobilized sperm and prevented their progression into the cervical canal. We intend to prepare and file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to commence a pivotal clinical trial. If approved, Ovaprene will be a first-in-category therapy for women seeking a hormone-free, self-administered and non-invasive birth control method.""

Something to pull away from this is that they are spreading awareness continuously during this month about their successful trials and upcoming products. Partners and investors are their major concern at the moment, and this is a great opportunity for them to pull in potential partners/investors based on previous successes.

**My Take**

Dare is not only a short term investment for the month of March, but a long term investment under a Biden administration. Biden has stated multiple times that women's health is a priority with his focus on health care during his presidency. This backed by other democrats could be a major upside for women's health companies such as Dare. Obviously I recommend you all do your own DD, but this company has the potential to blow up over the course of 2021 with its price target being moved to the $5 - 9 range.

m3hspu,gqrh1fc,investing,comment,1615604600,"So I am a Dr

I'm terrible at analyzing stocks or individual companies.  Plenty of pharmaceutical manufacturers are big time risks, this one included.  So, while I can't comment on the company itself, I think I can talk a little about how successful a drug can be...

Ovaprene: this is basically a diaphragm.  This may be a hard sell for a few reasons...
For one, if someone is going to use a temporary implant, they want it to be out of the way, painless, and not to interfere with sex drive.  It sounds like it covers all of the above.  You listed the major competitors of this product with exception to the copper IUD.  Copper IUD's are the most effective contraceptive device on the market, AND they don't have hormones.  Like all IUD's they are initially painful when placing, but usually lasts a brief period of time.  The copper IUD can cause more painful or heavier cycles, but it rarely gets dislodged, as it is far past the cervix when placed.  The copper iud is more expensive than other IUD's, and honestly I don't know why.  So when I think of non-hormonal contraceptives that arent condoms or spermicides, I think of copper iud's.  This will likely be the biggest competitor.  IF it pans out that ovaprene passes trials, AND gets marketed correctly, AND proves to be effective, AND is more comfortable/less side-effects than copper, then I can see this product being a huge success.  But those are a lot of ifs...

And there's also nuvaring...  not sure how they are gonna sell against nuvaring.

Sildenafil cream: there are case reports here and there of women who accidentally took their husbands viagra.  short answer: its been prescribed as an off label use for hypoactive sex drive, but it is not FDA approved.  Flibanserin/Addyi was supposed to be the big one: viagra for women.  It had 2 rejections by the FDA because of serious side effects like low blood pressure worsened by alcohol and contraceptive pills.

sildenafil cream: If this works as well as it sounds - this may be the most profitable product you listed above. 


DARE BV-1: this product has too many competitors.  I am surprised they are pursuing this given how easy it is to treat BV.  We used to treat BV with a single day of antibiotics metronidazole.  And a lot of doctors still do this.  Its cheap, and effective, and yea, the side effects suck (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea), but you will be hard pressed to convince docs to use a topical antibacterial for BV if it ends up being more expensive than the $5 worth of metronidazole.  ADDITIONALLY, we already have clindamycin cream out which has been used for BV.  It resulted in antibiotic resistance and increased rates of re-infection. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15507930/


I question the viability of all of these products except the topical sildenafil.  I worry that this is a pump and dump honestly...

m3cdt9,,investing,post,1615533365,"My 4 most anticipated IPO/DPO's for the rest of 2021New company listings are always exciting and I generally try to keep track of any big news surrounding unicorns. These days I look at the recent IPO filings on Nasdaq.com and all I see is a sea of SPAC haha.


I made a list in December of 2020 and with Roblox crossed off after their recent IPO I thought I'd share the next 4 in line and see if anybody wanted to share theirs as well. In addition to the unicorns, there are a ton of companies with potential out there that most people aren't too familiar with, so if you think you've got a 3, 5, or even 10 bagger then drop your names below!


Mine are as follows:


1.Applovin

1.45B revenue in 2020. Basically a company that helps app developers promote their app, acquire users, and monetize their app. Growing at a fast pace and has achieved profitability every year except for 2020 due to aggressive content acquisition and expansion. 


2.Vizio

2B revenue in 2020. This company is a household name and doesn't have the flashy revenue growth as other tech companies that are recently IPO-ing. But the idea that this company is going for is that they hope to model themselves after ROKU. They have a very high quality SmartTV OS and TV manufacturing line that is already vertically integrated, and they hope to expand by monetizing their Vizio SmartTV OS the same way Roku does- basically by SVOD, advertising, and selling user data. We'll see if it can catch ROKU in this market segment. 


3.Nextdoor

Just going out on a limb but I think COVID helped people who normally ignore their neighbors get to know them a bit better. Especially if you live in a condo/apartment or whatever. Nextdoor is a nifty app that lets people connect with their physical neighbors and communities, and I think COVID was just the right catalyst for them to take off. There's not much on this company that I could find regarding their financials unfortunately, but apparently at their last funding round in late 2019 they were valued at 2B, and apparently are looking for a valuation of maybe 5B in 2021. 

I am bullish though as Sarah Friar is heading Nextdoor. CFO of Square, Senior VP at Salesforce, and served on the Board of Directors of Walmart and Slack. Banking background. Very confident in her abilities to drive the vision of the company forward. 

4.This one was tough, but I think Olo is a great high upside pick. Olo builds the software and platform that connects restaurants to users. Notable brands that use them include the Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack, Wingstop, and Dennys. They can help build apps, order tracking software, and delivery coordination platforms for restaurants. 


There are some more high profile ones like Databricks, UIPath, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Instacart that aren't listed above but I wanted to share some lesser known ones that I'm personally bullish on and probably won't get as much attention.","['CRM', 'NDAQ', 'WMT']"

m339dm,,investing,post,1615503794,"Emerging Markets and Index Investing 

I'm passive investor with 5% of my portfolio in Emerging Markets (index). I've been thinking lately that it's not really worth it to invest in these stocks. Emerging market economies may indeed enjoy higher level of GDP growth than developed economies, but their corporate governance is substandard, corruption may be rampant, and the rule of law inconsistent. The result is that much of that growth is captured by insiders rather than by the public investors at large.

While the market is undoubtedly aware of the problems and presumably takes them into account when setting prices, I'm not confident the market can accurately price in unknown information (for example, we don't really know what goes on in China). Emerging Mkts is pehaps one of the few areas where active management makes sense. Indexing assumes the market is efficient, that assumption may not be true in some emerging markets.

I feel index investors are better off focusing exclusively on the US and other developed markets where we will get a fair shake. Large corporations like MCD and Coke already have exposure to emerging markets, and unlike locally traded shares, their financials are not suspect.",['MCD']

m339dm,gqmx055,investing,comment,1615508805,"Macro economics and politics matter more than valuations in EM, but don't write them off just due to political risk.

With valuations so high around the world, there really aren't any safe bets anymore. You are taking another type of risk by being entirely in developed market equities. 

A bet on EM is simply a bet that things will ""get better"" rather than get worse. If China can slowly grow to be 20% less crooked than they are today, then financial markets should reward them with higher multiples.

If you are okay with taking on the risk of investing in EM, here are some options besides a market index:

- DGS: One of the two EM ETFs I hold. It holds small companies only, so hopefully less political risk, and screens/weighs by dividends, because unlike financial statements you cannot easily fake a dividend. 

- AVEM: A relatively new ETF from Avantis that holds a smaller universe than VWO, with tilting towards quality/fundamentals.. without making big sector bets. Yes, fundamentals in EM can be cooked, but IMO this ETF will lean away from market bubbles that are common in that sphere. The team managing this ETF has a pretty good pedigree. 

- Actively managed funds: Vanguard has a good active fund. T Rowe does as well but I believe theirs is closed to new money. My advice is to pick a fund that checks these marks: fee under 1%, low turnover, less than 500 stocks, manager has skin in the game (you can verify via Morningstar), and I would avoid anything that leans too heavily towards growth/tech. All the above matter more than recent performance. 

For the record, I am heavily invested in EM but I also hold $1 in conflict hedge for every $5 of China exposure..so I am loaded up on LMT, NOC, LHX, and EAF. If China ever attacks Taiwan all global markets will crash anyway though, not just EM.

Edit: the reason to not hold the full index and instead hold a smaller universe...is because IMO successfully investing in EM is more about what you *don't* hold rather than what you hold. VWO is forced to hold every single Hong Kong listed stock, and I'd rather have a screen for fraud/bs/shenanigans. You can achieve that screen by using an active fund or an ETF that screens on dividends (DGS) or quality (AVEM).","['LMT', 'NOC', 'LHX']"

L Brands (owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body works) has been on a meteoric rise, hyped by investment analysts. It's in a classic bubble. Today the stock rose nearly 10% because the board revised earning projects and initiated a stock buyback. Not sure what factors have led this company to believe its earnings will be that good, when its business has been hugely impacted by the pandemic.

Stock is sitting at 61, last time it went above 60 was in 2017, and it dropped like a ROCK after that

At its core, the Victoria Secret brand is a losing business. It's based in shopping malls, which are closing left and right and are on a tremendous decline. Its products are not unique, there are many other brands and stores selling same cheaply made underwear. The stock has had an average PE of about 12, right now its at 18.

Stop me if you’ve heard this before: Technology stocks are selling off as bond yields are rising. Yes, we’re back to that narrative. 

As of 0620 Nasdaq futures are 1.6% lower. The S&P 500 is pointing to a drop of 0.5% at the open. Dow Industrials and small caps are flat. Commodities are lower: gold and silver down more than 1% and 2%, respectively. Copper down over 1% as well.

This all comes after the S&P 500 climbed to a record yesterday. Seeing how there is nothing else that has really emerged as a catalyst, this would lead one to surmise that the drop is due to profit taking. Though again, the fact that bonds are selling off as well is unusual.

Not much in the way of data releases today: PPIs at 0830. You’ll be hearing about the Michigan Consumer Sentiment but that is a backward-looking measure I have never found particularly useful.

m3mkc4,,investing,post,1615570316,"$SNBR Undervalued due to rich dataset from smart beds and macro tailwindsSleep Number Corporation has a vertically integrated line of air bed mattresses, which it sells direct to consumers. The company also sells ancillary bedding, including pillows and sheets. Historically this has been overwhelming accomplished through physical retail channels, with 92% of net sales being derived from physical retail locations in FY 2019. COVID, however, forced the company to pivot to online, phone, and chat sales, with online/phone/chat sales increasing 104% in FY 2020. This allowed the company to continue its phenomenal growth, with sales increasing by 9% y/y and earnings increasing by 82% y/y during the FY 2020 period despite COVID.

This financial performance has translated into considerable price appreciation in the stock. Sleep Number is up 70% YTD (thru 3.11.21) and 265% over the trailing year. It outperformed its conventional peer, TPX, by 114% over the trailing year period and the S&P 500 by 219% over the same period but underperformed its less conventional peer PRPL by 67% over the trailing year. Nevertheless, the recent price performance has caused the valuation to move higher relative to its conventional peer and to its historical average. The company now trades at 22.5x BF P/E vs. a 5-year historical average of 16.9x BF P/E and TPX's 14.9x BF P/E and at 12.9x BF EV/EBITDA vs. a 5-year historical average of 7.7x and TPX's 9.7x.

However, the company does trade at a significant discount to the new growth competitors in the space including Purple Innovation, Inc. and Casper Sleep, Inc. PRPL’s 37x BF P/E and 23x BF EV/EBITDA and CSPR’s operating losses make SNBR’s valuation look deeply discounted just on the basis of their financial performance.

Despite the growth peers, one might still conclude the company is overvalued on a historical basis and a return to the mean is in order. I strongly disagree and think the company is actually trading at a substantial discount to its tangible value for two principal reasons.

First, the company's forward prospects have substantially improved relative to historical periods making a mean reversion less likely due to the present value of future cash flows warranting a higher multiple. Future cash flows should benefit from macro trends in the United States, particularly increasing homeownership evidenced by the MBA Purchase Applications Index. More company-specific, though, and differentiating it from its competitors is the foresight Sleep Number’s management had in investing in significant consumer trends within their space. These trends are as follows:

· *""First, consumers are prioritizing wellbeing – their own and that of their families, and they understand the strong link between sleep and overall health and wellness;*

· *Second, consumers are adopting digital products and services at a much faster and higher rate, and they are increasingly relying on digital health solutions; and*

· *Third, consumers have a heightened preference for brands that are characterized by authentic purpose and human empathy."" (Sleep Number Corporation 2019 10K)*

Identifying these trends allowed management to prioritize investment into their 360 Smart Bed and their SleepIQ technology, which they presented at CES in 2017. This has resulted in such innovations as ""Nighttime Heart Rate Variability (HRV)"" – a measure of the variation of time between each heartbeat, a datapoint which the 360 Smart Bed is able to capture. This innovation materially differentiates Sleep Number from competitors and appears to some degree to be driving sales. Iterative innovation could also drive increased replacement cycles amongst customers. The most important result of this innovation, though, is the unaddressed white space created by the dataset they are actively collecting.

Thus, the second reason why I believe the company is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value is the repricing from a well-run vertically integrated bed manufacturer to a technology company with a substantial repository of sleep data and a significant installed user base.

Sleep Number's platform captures 13 billion biometric data points nightly across the United States. SleepIQ leverages artificial intelligence on this data to better understand the quality of sleep and actively adjusts the 360 Smart Bed's settings to optimize for a better night's sleep giving tangible return for consumers. This data can also be linked to Apple Health Kit to be studied by the user.

The dataset gives Sleep Number a substantial asset akin to road data in autonomous driving applications deepening their competitive advantage. The application and use of the dataset could produce products such as subscription-based sleep solutions with reoccurring revenue, which the company could roll out to its substantial existing installed user base. A concept being discussed in the board room amongst the company’s excellent Board given Daniel Alegre’s, President and COO of Activision Blizzard, involvement and given the questions on the matter from sell-side analysts as recently as on the last earnings call (2/17/21).

In an age where data is increasingly regarded as the new oil, Sleep Number is woefully undervalued at 13x BF EV/EBITDA.","['AAPL', 'SPGI', 'ATVI', 'COO']"

m39uwn,,investing,post,1615523940,"Plus, NVIDIA Partner on Heavy Truck Autonomous Driving SystemPlus has received more than 10,000 preorders for its autonomous truck driving system, which is expected to be commercially available in 2022 in the U.S., China and Europe.

Plus, a self-driving truck technology company, has made several recent announcements:

The company will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) in its autonomous driving systems.A former Navistar exec has joined Plus as chief platform officer.Plus recently raised $200 million in new funding.

Plus was founded in 2016 and specializes in self-driving technology for large-scale autonomous transport. The company is starting mass production of its autonomous driving system for heavy trucks this year. 

According to a press release, the company will expand its feature set and operating design domain over time through over-the-air software updates. By working with the NVIDIA engineering team to further evolve its system, Plus will make it possible for trucks powered by its system to achieve fail-operational performance for on-road safety.

“Enormous computing power is needed to process the trillions of operations that our autonomous driving system runs every fraction of a second. NVIDIA Orin is a natural choice for us and the close collaboration with the NVIDIA team on a custom design for our system helps us achieve our commercialization goals,"" says Hao Zheng, Plus CTO and cofounder. ""We have received more than 10,000 pre-orders of our system, and will continue to develop our next-generation product based on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform as we deliver the systems to our customers.""

The Plus autonomous driving system is designed to make long-haul trucks safer and more efficient. Because of the size and weight of heavy trucks, which can total 80,000 lbs. with a fully-loaded trailer, they need more time to come to a stop and to maneuver.

Plus’ system uses lidar, radar and cameras to provide a 360° view of the truck’s surroundings. Data gathered through the sensors help the system identify objects nearby, plan its course, predict the movement of those objects and finally control the vehicle to make it move safely.

The NVIDIA Orin, which can deliver 254 trillion operations per second, can handle the large number of concurrent operations and support deep neural networks to process and make decisions using the data on heavy trucks outfitted with the Plus autonomous driving system. Orin is also designed for ISO 26262 Functional Safety ASIL-D at the system level for safety.

“Plus and its automated trucks are delivering true social benefits today through improved safety and efficiency,” says Rishi Dhall, vice president of autonomous vehicles, NVIDIA. 

To support the global deployment of its self-driving truck technology, Plus has added two new senior hires; Mooney, who was most recently senior vice president of global product development at Navistar and Chuck Joseph, who joined from Amazon’s Global Transportation Technology Group.

The company also closed $200 million in new funding in February led by new investors Guotai Junan International, CPE, and Wanxiang International Investment. Existing investors including Full Truck Alliance (FTA) also participated. Plus will use the funding to develop a sales and support network to help fleets integrate the Plus automated trucking system into their daily operations. The company will also scale deployments in the U.S. and China, and expand internationally to Europe and other parts of Asia.

Plus also recently announced collaborations with Amazon AWS, Blackberry QNX, and Ouster

* Shift is an online platform where you can buy used cars and/or sell your used car. Their main competitors are Carvana and Vroom.

***I've never heard of Shift..can they even compete with big players like Carvana?***

* Used car sales are actually consistently greater than new car sales in the US, and for over a decade, the rate of used car sales has been growing faster than the rate of new car sales. The total used car market in the US was $841b in 2019, yet less than 1% of all car sales in 2019 occurred on an ecommerce marketplace like Carvana or Shift. This is at odds with the trends, as more consumers are moving towards doing most if not all of their shopping online. This trend was accelerated with the COVID 19 pandemic. There is plenty of space for growth in this category for several major players. 

***What separates Shift from their competitors, such as Carvana and Vroom?***

* Shift has several unique features compared to their competitors. They are the only service in their space that offers free test drives at your home. If you see the car you like online, you can request to test drive it, and Shift will bring it to your door for you to test drive with no commitment to buy. They also focus on older cars compared to their competitors, specifically cars that are 3-5 and 6-10 years old. They also focus on cars that are less than $20k in price, with 40% of their sales being $10k-$20k and 16% being <$10k. Cars of this age and price range are the largest segment of the used car market. For reference, 1-3 year old car listings comprise 48% of Carvana's and 68% of Vroom's listings, compared to just 25% of Shift's. Cars priced over $20k comprise 79% of Vroom's listings and 27% of Carvana's, compared to 20% of Shift's. 

***Where does Shift operate?***

* They currently operate primarily in the west coast including California, the state with the largest number of vehicles sold per year, Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. In Q4 of 2020, they launched four hubs in Texas, the state with the third largest vehicle market, in Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, with more plans for future expansion.

***The Numbers***

Here's how Shift's current numbers stack up against their competitors:

 Feature | Shift | Carvana | Vroom*
---|---| ---| --- |
Share price as of 3/10/2021 | $8.55 | $260.45 | $34.10
Market Cap | $716M | $44.8B | $4.62B
Total Enterprise Value (TEV) | $497M | $46.7B | $3.92B 
2020 Revenue | $195.7M | $5.58B | $1.36B
Estimated 2021 Revenue (average of analysts) |$445M | $8.7B | $2.51B
Estimated 2021 Revenue Growth % |127% | 56% | 85%
2020 TEV/REV |2.54x | 8.3x | 2.88x
NTM TEV/REV  | 1.1x | 5.36x | 1.56x
NTM TEV/EBITDA  | -4.41x | -563x | -16.2x

*Note that Vroom is down nearly 33% this month and is just now approaching levels comparable to Shift at its current price level. 

From the table above, we can see that by buying Shift, you are paying a lower multiple even when factoring in analyst's average estimates of larger growth (over 100%) in 2021 compared to their competitors. 

***Recent Earnings (3/09/2021)***

Shift has been growing very rapidly and shows no signs of slowing down: 

* In Q4 of 2020, they sold 4,666 units earning $73.4m revenue, representing 147% and 168% year over year growth and ended the year at $195.7m in total revenue (18% YoY growth) with 13,135 units sold. 

* Their margins have also drastically improved, with their adjusted gross profit per unit in 2020 being $1,350 compared to $811 the year before, a 66% change. This has been largely due to their focus in 2020 on building up their in-house recondition (repairs/maintenance) team instead of relying on 3rd party mechanic vendors, with only 14% of cars being reconditioned by 3rd parties in Jan of 2021 compared to 45% at its peak. 

* As they have grown their in-house reconditioning team's ability to process cars in house, they have invested significantly in acquiring inventory, and have increased their sellable inventory by 148% from December 2020 to March 2021. 

* As of Dec 31st, 2020, the company had $234m in cash and cash equivalents and $49m in inventory, with $312m in total assets and $74.9m in total liabilities. 

***2021 Guidance:***

* For Q1 of 2021, they are guiding revenue of $90m-$95m, representing 200-217% YoY growth. For 2021, they are expecting $450M in revenue, a 130% YoY increase and is inline with analyst's expectations, with $1,600 adjusted gross profit per unit, a 19% YoY increase, which is on track for their target of $2,500 in the next few years.


***Disclaimer*** 

* I hold shares in Shift and continue to buy at these prices as I am bullish on the company. Thanks for reading",['TGT']

m2qd6k,gql9zt1,investing,comment,1615481906,"I agree with you that VRM and SFT are more attractive than CVNA.  CVNA is obscenely overvalued IMO.  CVNA has walmart margins and software P/S.

I think the more interesting question is what advantages do these companies have over Carmax?  Carmax will ship to my house for $100.  They also allow test drives and give money back guarantees.

Used car sales is not exactly a high margin business.  Carmax gets about 20% gross margins.  Carvana averaged 14% gross in 2020. Vroom hasn't even cracked double digits.  Maybe these E-commerce only firms can eek out a little more by cycle maturity with fixed cost & labor savings of over Carmax' online / brick & mortar hybrid model.

I still have trouble justifying the purchase.  SFT is slated to lose $1.50 a share next year with a book value of $3/share.  Working capital and Capex for expansion are huge in used cars.  There will be dilution before they achieve profitability, probably quite a bit of it.Vroom is in better shape, though their SG&A grew faster than revenue this year.  This isn't software.  Expansion is expensive and painful.

None of these firms will be able to achieve profitability with the equity they have today.  There is extreme uncertainty around how much of the pie you'll have when these companies do hit profitability, if ever.

Carmax is adopting the e-commerce model, they already have the infrastructure, positive earnings, positive FCF, and 1x P/S.  You get the potential upside of E-commerce market share without the risk of a company at -30% operating margins and no roadmap to profitability.

&#x200B;

P.S.

I think you messed up your EV on CVNA.  Their market cap is $46 billion and their total balance sheet is $3 billion.  No way to get to $22 billion.  Make sure you used both share issues, it looks like you only used their primary issue.","['KMX', 'WMT']"
m2qd6k,gqlgach,investing,comment,1615484618,"I'm a believer in SFT for a number of reasons that OP has outlined.  I've been observing the used car market closely over the last 9 months since I initially interviewed with Shift (corporate position) pre-SPAC IPO.  When interviewing, I performed diligence regarding the used car industry and found there have been major increases in used car prices (not to mention that many of the long-term unemployed are inundating the market as they seek cheaper solutions for major assets). Have been holding SFT and VRM in varying degrees (currently hold 203 SFT shares @ 8.81 average and got out of VRM position bc I deemed SFT to be significantly more valuable at current valuations in comparing offerings/tech).  Ultimately it's a great price point for a company with all the capabilities of the vastly more valued Carvana (and VRM to an extent).  I'd say conservative short term upside is $15 range (50% people, you heard me) and there is no reason it cannot continue to grow and take up greater market share long term.

PS tried to buy a used car through Carvana (would have used SFT if they had the specific vehicle I was seeking) and it was the absolute worst service I have ever dealt with.  Didn't get my car for over a month past the expected date so I eventually had to cancel after numerous futile conversations with Carvana employees.  Fuck those guys.",

m7vskw,,StockMarket,post,1616087868,"Understanding Cathie Wood's vision for Palantir/PLTRCathie Wood, easily one of the best investors of our time, is very committed to PLTR. Her vision for this stock might not make sense to some people and I can understand why. They aren't making profits and if you consider their financials, their stock shouldn't even be valued at where it is now. Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, came on CNBC and blatantly stated that if you are not in this company for the long run, it is not for you. I fully agree. You have to have vision when it comes to stocks like this, you have to understand it's potential. And jeez, Palantir has soo much potential for growth.

Palantir is a software company that deals with data. Data will be very important in the future; It will do so many things for companies and it's software is ahead of it's time. 17 years in the making. 17 fucking years in the making, endless amounts of funding by the government to make this technology happen. It really has no competitors that come close to what they are doing. It has happened. They are pushing their technology to the commercial market, they have already signed so many deals and made so many partnerships with BIG companies and government contracts. A lot of clients are actually INVESTING in the company. That speaks for it self. What I find interesting is that Palantir actually has no marketing team... crazy to think about, but it just reassures my conviction in this company. It is just the beginning for Palantir.

Palantir will lead many frontiers in the coming and near future, AI for one. AI is expected to reach 733.6 billion by 2027. If it leads in markets such as AI, imagine the growth Palantir will have. I believe it is going to be one of the few companies that will reach a 1 trillion valuation.

People really haven't realized what this company is doing, and once they do, liftoff ladies and gentlemen, buckle up.

This is just a very basic explanation as to why you should be investing in Palantir. Let me know your thoughts.",

I started investing/trading just a few months ago and the mental turmoil is a lot more that I expected, to be completely honest. Losing money in stocks you thought would take off just for them to go red and drain your account is very disheartening. I’ve seen a lot of tickets go up double digits, even triple, in percentage and have given in to FOMO more than I’d like to admit. Nothing is worse than seeing massive gains turn into massive loss. I’ve thought about giving up so many times. I’ll say it right now, I’ve been in ruts of depression even if I’ve only lost a net few hundred dollars. In a crazy market like this, how are new investors supposed to keep up in this environment? 

This seems like a rant and doesn’t really fit here in an informative way, but it’s easy to dismiss the emotional and mental strength you need to participate in the market. To fellow new investors: you guys aren’t the only ones losing and you are not alone. Take a step back and analyze what you’re doing wrong and learn from your mistakes. Revaluate if you can handle the market and be real with yourself. Personally, I’m taking a break to get away from all of this. It has been eating me up everyday looking at my account and trying to catch tickers that aren’t going to absolutely wreck my account. For one, I need to work on patience and not expect instant gains/free money. If anyone can relate to my experiences, I hope this helps you out in any way and give you motivation to not give up.

*****

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-dollar-general-signet-jewelers-petco-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq, S&P 500 futures hit by another jump in Treasury yields

> * Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures fell Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 14-month high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed steep losses Wednesday as Treasury yields came off their highs of the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed market concerns about higher policy interest rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 33,000 level for the first time ever. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high. Dow futures were steady Thursday.

> * While raising its outlook for economic growth and inflation, the Fed cut its unemployment rate forecast to 4.5% this year. The unemployment rate was 6.2% in February. In another hint about the jobs picture, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET, economists expect 700,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down from the prior week’s 712,000 initial jobless claims.

*****

> # 2. Bond traders continue to battle the Fed on rates

> * Despite Fed assurances that near zero rates likely won’t rise through 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield Thursday touched 1.74%, a high back to January 2020, as traders continued to battle central bankers on rates. The rapid climb in the benchmark yield, which started this year under 1%, has been a drag on high growth stocks, many of which are tech stocks on the Nasdaq, as higher rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. In addition to releasing projections Wednesday afternoon after its two-day March meeting, the Fed left rates and its asset purchase program unchanged.

*****

> # 3. Top Biden officials and Chinese diplomats set to meet

> * America’s top diplomat early Thursday pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, hours after reclusive Pyongyang vowed to ignore any U.S. overtures to resume negotiations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the end of security talks with South Korea in Seoul.

> * Blinken will meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington later Thursday. Ties between the world’s two largest economies have been torn for years and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it’s ready or willing to back down from the hardline stance taken under former President Donald Trump.

*****

> # 4. House to vote on two immigration bills, including one for ‘Dreamers’

> * The House was set to vote Thursday on a bill to give so-called Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids, full legal status and a chance for citizenship. A second measure would do the same for immigrant farm workers. Both measures seemed certain to pass. When similar versions of the bills passed the House in 2019, seven Republicans voted for the Dreamers bill and 34 backed the farm workers measure. However, GOP support is expected to plummet this time as the party rallies behind demands for tougher restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

*****

> # 5. Federal April 15 tax-filing day delayed until May 17

> * The federal April 15 tax-filing day has been postponed about a month. Taxpayers can also delay payment of any money owed the IRS until May 17. However, the extended deadline applies only to federal income returns and taxes, meaning that taxpayers will need to check to see if due dates for state taxes have been changed. Not all states follow the same filing schedule as the federal government. Calls to delay Tax Day intensified after passage of the latest Covid relief plan, which tasks the IRS with sending another round of direct payments at the same time it usually processes tax returns and refunds.

Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advice. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis.

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

ROLLS-ROYCE

RYCEY/RYCEF stock tickers seem to be a safer long term investment. The stocks tanked after COVID ruined the world economy, and the stocks are expected to reach pre-COVID levels within the next 2-5 years at the latest. Currently, RYCEY is $1.88 per share, pre-COVID, it was sitting pretty around $8-10 per share. They did add 6 billion shares during this period which created a share dilution and the company did lose about $4.5 billion dollars in the last year due to COVID, but I am confident that it will rebound, here’s why. The company has been producing turbine engines and propulsion systems for military aircraft, civil aircraft (including engines for Boeing and several other aircraft companies) and for various other applications. Being that they are the largest manufacture of engines for the RAF (British Air Force), they are government backed so they are most likely here to stay. On top of that, Rolls-Royce is getting into electric planes and they are on track to create the fastest electric plane ever made. Not only that, but they are getting involved in the energy sector. They are looking to create solutions in energy consumption and efficiency. Analysts are estimating that within the next year, the price target is at the lowest estimate $2.18, Median is $4.38 and high is $6.25. To be honest, I’m fairly new to investing but I think that this is an opportunity. I am open to other ideas and a discussion, but I wanted to ask for your input! I have 3,000 shares and am already up 21% since I first purchased at $1.55 late February. I’m thinking of holding long term, but again, I want to know what you guys think!","['BA', 'TGT']"

With an IPO or DPO, you don't really know what the market price is going to be.

With a SPAC, you already know it is priced at $10, and they do a back-room deal to effect the merger with a small premium, usually it ends up being $11-12. If it shoots up, it is generally on news, and moves before the news is public. And comes back down. There is also usually a private placement at around $12-14, so it is very unlikely to settle higher than that unless good news comes out right after the merger. And the company doesn't really want that; the good news happening before the merger helps their insiders a lot more, because they get a better value for the private placement.

SPACs are not get-rich-quick vehicles, they're backroom fake-IPOs. The only way it helps the retail trader is that we can speculate at $10-11, sell on the peak after the merger is announced, and be gone before it settles back down to $14. With an IPO, it starts high, and then settles downwards, so they usually suck for swing traders. Coupang is the ""Korean Amazon"" though, it is a special case with serious investment potential regardless where it settles in the short term. Roblox is more like a typical IPO/DPO; it was worth the $45 reference price, and there is no reason for it to sustain higher valuations without some sort of major news.👼",['AMZN']

m7pi43,,StockMarket,post,1616069724,"Why we are down in the futures today - Why the news from the FOMC meeting was actually bad for the marketsThe FOMC meeting was met with extreme optimism. At 2 pm est on wednesday the 17th we had a huge rally in all the indecies even putting SPX close to 4000 and QQQ above the daily 20SMA and 50SMA in one swoop. 

This was not the reaction that the news from the FOMC meeting deserved. It seems like the markets expected much worse news like the FED tampering asset purchases which was'nt realistic. In a post i made yesterday I had my realistic worst case scenario which was about what happened yesterday.   


1. **Real GDP projections skyrocketed from 4.2 to 6.5 for 2021**  
GDP can increase because of 2 things; economic growth & inflation. Even though USA has printed trillions of dollars they have not seen almost any growth. Instead money is flowing out of the country shown in the trade deficits. The main reason for the GDP projections are therefore not because of expectations of economic growth as some news media try to portray it as.   

2. **PCE inflation projections for 2021 rose from 1.8 to 2.4**   
This projection i did expect to rise but this is a really bad projection and it tells me that the FED either have no idea what is going on or the FED has become too politically motivated and is straight up lying to calm the bond- & stock markets. We should expect PCE inflation to increase alot more than 2.4% for 2021 because of all of this liquidity in the markets and the opening up of the economy, the PCE inflation will be much higher (Or already is much higher) around 5%.   

3. **The dot chart showed more economists at the FED projecting the federal funds rate to increase eariler than last projections.**   
This goes hand in hand with the PCE inflation projections. Because PCE inflation projections ticked up higher the projections for when the federal funds rate will increase should also be earlier.   

4. **The FED wont initiate yield curve control**  
The FED have no interest to initiate yield curve control which is understandable considering their amazing projections for the future. Jerome Powell did though wink to the bond holders that if yields rise too much they will step in.   
This is in my opinion the worst news coming out of this event. In a short period of time we have seen the 10 year treasury yield rally 240%, panic selling on the bond market like this has never been remotely close to happening since the 1970's and even then it's did'nt sell at the velocity of which it sells now. Even though we see bonds sell at this rate and record high trade deficits without notable economic growth the FED let it be. This tells me the FED either have a strategy they are not expressing or they have lost control of the bond market, meaning; the economy.   


After the event we saw a huge rally in everything. I attribute this to the great projections the FED made for the coming years. Sadly, reality hit and we see the futures market push the lows of yesterday, we see bond yields go up even faster than before now standing strong at 1.731%, the FED is about to lose this chicken race with the invisible hand. 

What I am going to do: I've had the bulk of my investments in the European markets. This is something that has been talked about by CNBC and so on since mid 2020. I will still keep a trading account to make risky trades on the US markets and for the coming 3 months i will trade it as a bear. (This is not financial advise, you make your own decisions)   


**TL;DR**   
Even though we saw a rally after the FOMC meeting it was actually a fakeout. The news from the FOMC meeting was bad and after the market has reflected on it, the selling begins.",['PM']

m7abva,,StockMarket,post,1616014270,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 17, 2021Stocks edged higher, rallying sharply in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) key monetary policy meeting and an upgraded economic outlook by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields rose again, with the 10-year benchmark at 1.646% at the time of writing.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak tomorrow.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

Concerns continue to flare regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Germany, France, Italy, and Spain becoming the latest countries to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination efforts, which were already behind schedule. Studies are currently being conducted in the UK and other places. More information is needed.

As u kno options are not priced to move like a stock does. The person selling you the option around this time might charge you a higher premium to buy your calls. Where that comes from is something called implied volatility (IV). IV is probably higher around IPOs, if it has a ridiculously high IV like over 100% then maybe hold off and wait for that to go down.

m7g0dk,,StockMarket,post,1616031163,"Verizon share price article.From the trends and targets website. Cannot cut and paste the annotated chart:


""Everyone's hero, Warren Buffett, dumped his Apple shares and found himself using the pocket change generated to buy one or two shares in US telecoms giant Verizon. In fact, his company Berkshire Hathaway are now Verizon largest shareholder. Obviously, the markets regard this as quite a big deal and a Trends and Targets quick survey of hedge funds shows a substantial majority bullish on the share prospects.


Unfortunately, the last few years have not been particularly kind to many hedge funds, their reputation somewhat tarnished due to the horrific number which shut down.


Despite everyone being eager to find 'the next Tesla share', it's generally far safer to explore slower, safer, and more stable companies, though obviously worth considering what field they are in, along with their future potentials. In telecoms, the demand is obviously for a high tech future and to judge by their press releases, Verizon are producing all the right 5G noises for the USA market.




Despite all our optimistic writing, we're pretty far from convinced the immediate future is rosy for Verizon, the immediate trend indicating the risk of weakness below just 54 dollars driving the share price back to a visually appealing 52 dollars. We like this level as it promises some sort of bounce but the danger comes should 52 break as ongoing travel down to targets of 50.5 dollars (or less) calculates as possible. As the chart below highlights, this presents an issue.


By breaking the Red uptrend since 2010, the share price enters a region where ""bottom"" calculates down at $44 in the event our 50.5 level breaks. This, in theory, is the case anyway but we've some doubts. Inevitably, a bunch of smart folk would review any break of trends as an opportunity, especially if a share price failed to make it below its most recent low. In the case of NYSE:VZ, this suggests the price requires break below the $49 level to justify hysterical behaviour.


In summary, we suspect Verizon shall reverse from its current 55 dollars but we're more inclined to regard the movement as presenting an opportunity for the longer term.




For everything to come up roses, the share price currently requires exceed $59 to enter a region, where growth to an initial $68 is hoped with secondary, if bettered, at 72 US dollars. Importantly, we cannot calculate any targets above the $72 dollar level for this company. This does not mean a ceiling awaits, just should it exceed 72 dollars, it enters unknown territory where things can become very illogical! Perhaps worth keeping an eye on, if contemplating a 'fire and forget' long position.""","['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'BRK.B', 'VZ']"

m7vpcc,,StockMarket,post,1616087629,"Healthy Discussion About Potential Risk of GameStop, Please Support This Thread 

Hi Mods and Apes,

I want to create a thread where we can have a healthy discussion of the potential risk of GME. WallstreetBets is turning itself as GMEBet nothing else. GME is not that relevant anymore in my opinion. Anything raising doubts or discussing potential downside will be downvote to dead. Whenever I reply to a comment will get the downvote attack as well. or fill with trash comments like apes can't read etc. It's toxic and unhealthy. The posts that I put up got taken down in 5 seconds due to not enough popularity. How? Is that manipulation? or we need better training for the new mods?

I'm betting against GME with leap options as I disclosed before. So at this level, I think GME is dangerous and have more downside than upside looking at every single metric.

Here is what I'm thinking:

* Next week post earning. GME is likely to announce a huge secondary offering to pay down debt and raise capital. This makes perfect sense given the amount of buyback they did in the past. This is a once-a-lifetime opportunity for GME which is great.
* There is no easy way to turn this company around. I don't say this easily, but EA has Origin, Activision has Battle Net, Ubisoft has its own, and Steam. How many of you are buying games majority from retail these days? I'm talking about the mainstream. Looking at those companies earning. There is no sign this will be changing anytime soon.
* I don't know the short squeeze gamma squeeze still holds, you can claim all data are fake, then I'm not sure why people are still living or trading in this country. Even the stock price is fake, it doesn't matter if it has a short squeeze or not. The big boys can just change the price like a video game. If you are on fake news and fake data camp. Please move on.
* Many big tech and great companies are getting hammered. Either people are selling to meet their margin requirement or reserving cash to buy the dip later, GME is not comparable to many of the good deals out there.
* SEC may be stepping in at any time for some actions, good or bad will impact the stock price. It's clear to me that there were many hedge funds were involved in driving up the stock price (P&D), there are still a ton of bag holders at the 300 and 400 levels if you disagree. So someone will definitely get caught for some illegal behavior at some point. There are 2 different kinds of hedge funds just so you know, the short that got burned, and the speculating ones that gain a ton off retail apes.

TL:DR

We're here at WSB is to try to make money and beat the market. So even GME was good at one point is no longer good at this level. If you disagree, but please be civil and nice. Bring up your points rather than trashing talks and attacks.",['EA']

For every share you own in these company they pay you a few cents a month per stock which definitely can add up to good monthly sums when you own many shares.

To start with, high yield might just mean the stock price dropped; by a lot. By too much. Also, low quality stocks often raise their yields really high, even though the company is doing poorly, to get people to buy it and push the stock price up artificially. This either means that the insiders know the company is failing and want time to cash out, or else they're getting ready to dilute the stock badly and want a good price.

Just now Powell came out to speak, but it was still insipid, but DK noticed that what he said had kind of followed the Wall Street script.

Powell said that inflation will rise in the coming months compared with the same period in 2020, and some of them are deliberately reminding everyone that he has read the minds of Wall Street.

According to the inflation data in February a few days ago, everyone feels that the increase is not very large compared with that in 2020. Wall Street has laid the groundwork here. Oil prices rose a lot in March this year, and inflation was the lowest point in March last year. So if you go ahead with the script, when you release inflation data in March, there will be a lot of hype about an increase compared with last year, causing market panic.

So here DK gives everyone an early warning, either prepare cash or avoid the risk of panic in advance. Just this month, 1400 US dollars in relief funds are coming in one after another, and many people are running in. Early next month is the season for harvesting retail investors.

*****

> # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall

> * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve’s post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday’s trend and finished higher.

*****

> # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy

> * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won’t overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January’s 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

*****

> # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters

> * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

> * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to “a lot of people that don’t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.” However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.

*****

> # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday’s U.S.-China meeting

> * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan’s first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won’t deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.

> * Reflecting Washington’s concern about the erosion of Hong Kong’s rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America’s “sinister intention to interfere in China’s internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China’s stability and development.”

*****

> # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle

> * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won’t receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of Uber fell more than 2% in U.S. premarket trading.

Looking over S3 Partners data, AMCs short interest is  8.2% (squeezable), GMEs is 12.93% (squeezable), but KOSS is at 38.41%?!?  

The free float available is 872,000 shares to trade, but the volume today was 3,160,000, but the price only went up 2.77%?  With that much volume on that low of a float, and over a third of the shares tied up in short positions, how is this not skyrocketing with any small amount of movement, and why is there barely any interest at all on this sub or WSB?

Please someone that has eaten less crayons than me, tell me why this isn't a prime setup for an epic short squeeze?  I don't think the same fundamental case exists for KOSS like it does with AMC or GME so I don't want to go more than 5% of my capital on a position, especially since for whatever reason there's no attention here for it.

As you noted, the level it's been shorted is interesting though.

Looking at Interactive Brokers Stock Loan Availability KOSS has had zero shares available for loan today, pretty much since market open this morning. There were no shares available from 07:00:00 to 09:45:00 and then no additional entries after 09:45:00, so currently still none available according to IB's reporting which is updated every 15 minutes. That doesn't necessarily mean it can't be shorted further, IB's reporting is just one small piece of the puzzle, but would seem to align with S3 reporting an increase in short interest.

m7nxk3,,StockMarket,post,1616063426,"VXX an upcoming volatility hedgeSo, I usually play a volatility spike 2-3 times a year. I got lucky (or had the guts) to buy VXX in January 2020, when the so called pandemic was about to hit and was up 40% when most people were down the same. I got lucky again (or had the guts) to buy VXX again in late January 2021, when a certain paedophile stole an election, and made some nice gains again. 

Going back to the well, as the aforementioned PEDO (God I miss 45), is making quick work of dismantling the economy and turning the keys over to China. Don't believe me? Just visit your local gas station.

I believe volatility will spike again with quadruple witching this Friday (I bought VXX Tuesday). It was moving nicely until the Fed, protecting a certain paedophile, announced a rosy outlook for the economy, reversing index loses for the day.

I believe a correction is inevitable. This PEDO is raising taxes, first time in 33 years, which will crush the economy. In addition, interest rates are climbing and inflation is heating up.

VXX stochastics are turning positive, another favorable technical input, is near a 52 week low (all time?), and the market seems to be topping out.

In addition, if there is a market disruption due to certain popular meme stocks squeezing, volatility WILL spike; causing VXX to moon.

I wished the MACD were positive but it should follow course, shortly. 

In conclusion, VXX seems prime for good upside. If you are looking for a hedge for your portfolio, there are worse options out there than VXX. 

If you are worried market may be capitulating, economy is worsening, or expect a market correction VXX is a good choice for you (another option is VIXY, there are others, including leveraged).

m6wd6b,,StockMarket,post,1615972657,"Economic Moats/Competitive AdvantageWhat Warren Buffet calls the ‘economic moat’ we refer to as ‘competitive advantage’. The term refers to a companies ability to keep competition at bay over the long term life cycle of the business, maintain majority market share and favourable economics. What force is stopping or limiting the competitions capability to compete? What stops the competition from cutting their lunch? A company can have one or more of the five types of economic moats: intangible assets, cost advantage, efficient scale, switching costs, network effect. 

Here are Some examples of the economic moats/competitive advantage of some companies (or what I believe to be the moat) :

Apple — Apple’s brand power, the belief in its product superiority by consumers and its ability to create a large cult following, allows the company to price its products at double the competitions and still outsell the competition in the market place. 

Coca-Cola — The powerful brand behind Coke gives them the ability to demand higher margins and outsell the competition. Coke the brand is directly associated with happiness. Coke is a product where the customer will reject the competitions equivalent at a discount, and buy the Coke product at a premium. 

Intel — Intels vertical integration and its operations across the entire supply chain line in the chip sector, gives intel the ability to outdo the competition on every level and hold majority market share. One year intel will focus on chip innovation, the next year it will focus on production innovation and capabilities. Despite fierce competition from AMD and NVIDIA, intel has maintained its market share of the industry.

Amazon.com — Amazon is an operating system for society and daily lives of individuals. It has created a cult following who truly believe Amazon is a necessity of life equal to water, food and oxygen. Some Amazon prime members have and do become suicidal when they lose access to their account. The brand has made itself into an integral part of the day to day lives of individuals, and has made life without Amazon inconceivable for its customers. 

Facebook — Facebook takes advantage of network effects, product and brand power. As more people start using Facebook, then more people will be attracted to Facebook because their friends and everyone they know use it, it becomes a social necessity.

m6w3dm,,StockMarket,post,1615971541,"Trading can be fun, if we can only focus! It can be argued that trading is mostly psychological and it’s more true when taking on trades intraday.  The more trades you make, the more opportunity fear and greed can take over your trading.  I would like to pretend that I’ve developed habits to keep my emotions at bay, but I simply have processes in place that still require conscious effort to keep my mental state in check.

There are times when life can be overwhelming and prevent us from completely focusing on our trading.  Bad relationships, evil bosses, failing health and other stressful things in life can all have a negative impact on our trading.  If that’s the case, then what I state in this post will not help.  Please take care of those things first.

If everything else in life is in good shape, then why are you letting your emotions take over your trading?  The common denominator in this battle of emotions is focus.  Trading can be fun if we focus on our trading routine, our plans and overall trading system.

# Focus on the Routine

What’s the routine?  Do you scan for top gainers before the market opens? Do you review your watchlist before looking at the news?  Do you check the news before charting?  Do you analyze top gainers for entries and levels of support/resistance?  Do you create your alerts and review your watchlist during the day?  Do you do a retrospective and review your traders after hours?

You need to have a routine.  As an experienced trader, you have a routine of things you do before, during and after the trading day.  You can be in the zone because you don't have to think about doing these things that helped you succeed in the market.  At times the routine becomes second nature, where you don't even think about it any more.  You just do it!

The problem comes when you deviate from the routine and what you do becomes progressively different from the original ABCD routine (no relation to ABCD pattern) that's helped you become consistently profitable.  There's no problem in consciously changing a routine that needs modification, but it is an issue when you start skipping A, B, C or D when you become complacent in your profitability.  What you might not realize is that those individual parts of your routine all worked together as one functional unit.  Not doing one could affect the outcome of the other things you do as part of your routine.

If you're a beginner and you're not doing any of the things I listed above, then choose at least one or two of those things and do it every day you trade.  Scan for premarket gainers and check the news before the Open.  Review the stocks on your watchlist midday.  Track your trades and write a journal entry for the day after the market closes.  Whatever it is, do it consistently to develop good trading routines.

# Focus on the Plan

In addition to your routine, you should have a plan or something you want to execute or test every day you trade.  Are you going to focus on the opening range breakout?  Are you focused on playing those morning dips?  Are you playing bull flags or double bottoms?  Are you buying stocks that cross above a certain moving average?

There are plenty of ways for you to trade, but you need to focus on what is best for your style of trading.  Some patterns favor risk takers, while other patterns favor the more conservative trader.  The added uncertainty over playing patterns and strategies you're not comfortable with can lead to more risk taking. You can make huge profits playing just one or two patterns or strategies, but you're not going to be consistently profitable by playing everything at once.  It’s important that you focus on what you want to play before you get into the action.

If you're new to trading, then choose one or two patterns and strategies and play those until you can show consistent profit.  Play the opening range breakout (ORB) and focus on the first 5 minute candle.  Play the morning dips and focus on reversal patterns and finding an established level of support.  Play the breakouts and focus on the VWAP and moving averages.  Whatever you choose, focus on playing only those patterns and strategies until you see consistent profits.  This focus on a plan alone can grow your account exponentially.

# Focus on the System

A trading system puts together all the required aspects of successfully trading in the stock market:  risk management, money management, the things listed above in routines and plans, and whatever else you deem necessary to be a profitable trader.  But no trading system is complete if it doesn’t produce awareness and responsibility.

How do you internalize the market?  Are you identifying repeated actions and behaviors?  Are you constantly working on your weaknesses? Keeping a journal will improve your awareness as a trader, but simply having a journal on your desk and jotting down notes isn't enough.  You must personalize your experiences with the market, and use those experiences to be a better trader tomorrow.

m6i4s4,,StockMarket,post,1615925336,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Please enjoy!Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. 

Retail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. 

In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. 

With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.”

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

Big trading day ahead, will the Fed pause the music in this game of musical chairs... Will the Fed stop the music? Buy the rumor sale the news. We pushed thru and made another all-time high at 397.83 in the spy and promptly sold off thereafter. Can we push higher, is 400 in the cards today? No matter what happens, I will not execute any trades until after the fed speak. Also, be very careful of the head fake on the initial announcement. There is an obvious undertone in the broader market this Fed day; to Test and put pressure on the Fed by pushing rates higher and bond yields lower to see if the Fed will take action.  The 3 outcomes to prepare for are:1) Can we hold the 390-support area if so, we could have a sharp move toward 397-400 looking to take action on the reversal that may happen between today or expiration Friday. 2) We Break support at 390 area, giving us a consolidation zone between 397 and 390 before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. 3) Down trend Day we try to close overnight gap toward 395 area before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96.

1. Can we hold the 393-support area if so, we could have a sharp move toward 397-400 looking to take action on the reversal that may happen between today or expiration Friday. **50% probability**
2. We Break support at 393 area, giving us a consolidation zone between 397 and 390 before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. **40% probability**
3. Down trend Day we try to close overnight gap toward 395 area before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. **10% probability**

 [The Fed - Meeting calendars and information (federalreserve.gov)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)   


**Real GDP & PCE inflation projections** 

You don't want these to rise if you invest in growth stocks. Higher GDP projections mean higher inflation and higher PCE inflation means the FED will taper sooner making interest rates go up.   


**Jerome talking about yield control**   


If you are invested in growth stocks you want Jerome to start talking about yield curve control. This will be benificial for banks and growth stocks since it means more liquidity in the system. He has duiring the past interviews showed no interest in doing this though so don't expect this to happen. 

&#x200B;

**The dot plot changes**  


If you own growth stocks you want to look at the dot plot and see if anything changed from previous documents. The dot plot show individual expectations amongst the FED members of when the FED will raise interest rates and you don't want more people expecting interest rates to rise near term. 

&#x200B;

**What I expect (TLDR)**

Jerome has not expressed any interest in doing anything different from what the FED is doing at the moment. He has though expressed that the yields going up with such velocity has made him aware of it. What i expect from the meeting is higher real GDP, higher PCE inflation projections but no change in direction from the FED.

m706k5,,StockMarket,post,1615987041,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock that has seen rising chatter online.Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

### Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology & tourism growth
* AI & data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

### Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

&#x200B;

[5 Year Net Income for Teradyne, rising from -$43m in 2016 to $784m in 2020. Return on Equity was 42.49&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/et37l5sf9ln61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f4f34ee5c894e7084b21516a35309d21dc2878)

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

### Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

### Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

&#x200B;

[Choppy price action for TER this year, dropping from all time highs of $148.](https://preview.redd.it/lxmx8hhh9ln61.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec2e87089db55b57a7494d10096876124ffd1b66)

### Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.

Doing this implied 2021 rev. growth of 8% with just these customers (1/3 of revenue) vs street consensus of 6% for all revenue - maybe some cuts to other customer CAPEX e.g. ASE but I think this is representative. I personally think competitors will need to raise CAPEX guidance to TSMC levels to stay competitive and thus upside on rev. growth.

Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN has rise over 12% in value as it's currently being traded under $8.30 per share.

Yesterday attempt to move higher failed as it was capped at $7.50 three times in a row, resulting in a triple top.

Fortunately this triple top was canceled as the price found support at the pivot support at $6.75, which has resulted in a double bottom formation. Dip to this level attracted a lot of buying pressure and so far has resulted in almost 30% price increase in under few hours. (from $6.75 to $8.74)

The break of $7.30 led to a stronger buying momentum.

To see similar volume soon, the price of ZKIN would need to break above $9.00 per share, which is not impossible just not likely as much to happen in this run.

A more realistic would be a test of this bespoken resistance at $9.00 and then retest of $8.40.

As the price stands now, is currently in area from $7.80 to $8.40.

Indicators.

RSI is strongly bullish as its highly above 60 resulting in bullish momentum still being present and has a lot of room for correction before losing this momentum.

MACD is in a strong buying wave and the bullish momentum keeps increasing, however it can be capped soon as statistics suggests.

The short term trend has turned into an strong uptrend as 20 EMA broke above the 50 one.",

m6f5l4,,StockMarket,post,1615917644,"Changing Government Policy Effects on Telehealth/Healthcare StocksIt’s no secret that healthcare in the U.S. changes every 4 years. The party in office has a big impact on healthcare policy—which in turn affects our stocks. I’ve been following Amwell since it’s IPO in Sept. of 2020, so I was curious how the changing presidency would impact my stocks. I figured I would share my research: Here’s my deep dive into what effects the current administration is going to have on healthcare, and more specifically telehealth, and how this is going to affect current and ongoing stock prices. 

**Obama**

President Obama’s healthcare reform ultimately reduced the number of Americans uninsured. Though this is what the Affordable Care Act is most notably recognized for, it also created a larger conversation surrounding telehealth back in 2014. The ACA featured a promise of telehealth in new care models. Additionally, telehealth is attractive to a model such as the Affordable Care Act—one that aims to expand healthcare services by utilizing resources as efficiently as possible. 

Although COVID-19 caused a huge increase in telehealth across the country, use of telehealth has actually been growing for more than a decade. Many patients who benefit from telehealth are recipients of Medicare and Medicaid—two programs that have been nurtured by the Affordable Care Act. A report released in July of 2020 shows that more than 9 million Medicare beneficiaries had already used telehealth during the early stages of the pandemic. Without Obama’s policies that expanded coverage (though Trump *tried* to reverse this) these numbers may not have been as high.   
More Reads [HERE ](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2017/01/19/obama-legacy)& [HERE](https://californiahealthline.org/news/the-aca-and-telehealth-mutually-beneficial/) & [HERE](https://money.cnn.com/2015/01/21/investing/unitedhealth-earnings-obamacare).

**Trump**

Republicans are notorious for rolling back government spending, especially on healthcare. Trump was no different. Though he did not deliver on many of the promises he made on the campaign trail in 2016, he did make some changes that ultimately weakened the Affordable Care Act. This includes tossing out the penalty for not having health insurance—though this seemed to garner bipartisan support. The Trump administration also ended disputed cost-sharing subsidies and shortened the open enrollment period by half.

During Trump’s presidency, his administration made an attempt to also rollback Medicaid coverage. Thankfully, this attempt was not very successful; it would have had a detrimental impact on healthcare access during a global pandemic—which would’ve been just another terrible look for Trump. 

As the pandemic hit, lawmakers and regulators loosened policies to make telehealth through Medicare more “broadly available” during COVID-19. This expansion of services was vital—It may have saved lives as it allowed older Americans to access healthcare at home. We’ll chalk this up to one of Trump’s few wins in 2020. However, now the big question is: will these temporary policy changes become permanent? This will have a massive impact on telehealth as the Biden administration decides how to move forward. Up for discussion: the quality of care, cost to beneficiaries, and services that make sense for coverage.

**Biden**

What are the expected healthcare policies under Biden? As many of us have been reading, Biden and his administration plan to bring back many Obama-era healthcare policies. In addition to these policies, the Biden administration plans to strengthen and expand telehealth. [Policy ](https://www.aha.org/factsheet/telehealth)makers and hospitals alike are seeing the cost/benefit ratio as a positive one and plan on making some of the current expansions permanent. So, what is the long-term impact of post-pandemic policies on telehealth? CEO of Amwell [says](https://www.nanalyze.com/2021/02/top-telehealth-companies/), “recognizing the home as a valid place of care … changing some of the Medicare rules around reimbursement, \[and\] changing HIPAA rules to accommodate the fact that care is rendered outside facilities and hospitals.”

More Reads [HERE](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/28/trump-vs-biden-here-are-the-health-care-stocks-that-could-benefit-from-the-2020-election-.html) & [HERE](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/biden-presidency-health-care-sector-winners).

Covid quite obviously fast tracked telehealth services. These mobile and web apps make it possible for anyone to get help without the need of an office visit. However, both state and federal policy impact the success of telehealth—policy makers make decisions that not only impact Medicaid and Medicare recipients, but also impact physicians. Telehealth providers must go through a credentialing process for physicians. If the Biden administration can expand Medicare/Medicaid access while removing some of the red tape for providers, we could see stocks continuing to climb long after the pandemic ends. 

Teladoc, Nuance, and Amwell are great examples of how a telehealth stock has changed due to policy in conjunction with the pandemic. The success of these companies, unfortunately, depends upon state and federal government policies. No two states are the same in the way they approach telehealth—so this will be something to keep an eye on in the coming years. [Here’s](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/11/the-top-2-telemedicine-stocks-to-buy-in-october/) a great post from October 2020, predicting the two telehealth stocks to invest in, and it still holds true. 

Some examples of telehealth companies and the impact of the pandemic and government policies have had on them. If you’ve been following telehealth stocks, you know Teledoc is the big dog in the industry; Nuance is a fast-growing AI company with a focus on healthcare, and Amwell is a less-talked about telehealth player with a $100 million investment from Google. As I mentioned, I’ve been specifically following Amwell since last fall. 

[*Teledoc* ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TDOC/teladoc-health/stock-price-history)

This is a company that’s been around in the telehealth industry for years. As you can see, policy has had a very large effect on this stock through the years. 

*2015: Averaged $22.73avg*

*2016: Dropped 8.13%, to $15.10avg due to bringing in of new administration*

*2017-mid 2019: slowly climbed to $65.39avg*

*End of 2019(pandemic): $83.72avg*

*2020 all the way through election day: $177 avg because of pandemic, but got as high as $237*

*2020 election: went down to $117*

*After inauguration, went up to as high as $292*

[*Nuance* ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NUAN/nuance-communications/stock-price-history)

Here’s an example of a tech/communications company that entered the telehealth industry through its use of technology and has seen nothing but a steady incline since the pandemic and especially the election and inauguration.  

*2015: Averaged $16.60*

*2016: $16.40*

*2017-mid 2019:saw no real growth for this company. Right before the pandemic the stock was valued at $16.50*

*End of 2019(pandemic): stock began to rise. $18.03*

*2020 all the way through election day went as high as $35*

*2020 election: went from $35 down to $32*

*After inauguration, went up as high as $48.80*

[*American Well*](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMWL/american-well/stock-price-history)  
Here’s an example of a stock that went public because of their telehealth technology and wanting to capitalize on the need for telehealth during the pandemic. This gives a great example as to what, not only the pandemic has done to the stock, but what affects the election and inauguration have on healthcare stocks. 

*2020 opening: valued at $18*

*Oct 2020: stock went up to as high as $38.74*

*2020 Election: dipped all the way down to $25.10*

*After inauguration, went up to as high as $42.80*

In 2021, CEO of Amwell, Dr. Roy Schoenberg, has told journalists that he hopes the new administration will look favorably upon telehealth with upcoming policy changes. If these hopes come true, and we see policy that recognizes the home as a valid place of care, changes surrounding Medicare reimbursement, and changes to HIPAA rules—there is no telling where telehealth may go in the next 4 years of Biden’s presidency. I’m keeping one eye on policy and one eye on Amwell’s Q4 earnings coming up on March 24. 🚀",

This DD will cover different sectors on how CBAK is helping promote clean energy with their batteries.

CBAT is the battery that companies and the Chinese government is using to promote clean energy to help lower emissions to 0 by 2060. 

CBAT is silently killing the clean energy game and is discounted and heavily shorted, but the reason why it is not being talked about is because its a chinese company that only posts publications on chinese news website. The chinese news articles will be posted below if anyone is interested in reading them. But for now let me get to the main points that really fascinates me:

CBAT sells China General Nuclear Power Group batteries for their clean energy needs. CGN uses CBAT’s batteries for peak shifting frequency modulations and for their solar plants. “China General Nuclear Power's first power generation-side energy storage project-Yingjisha Photovoltaic Power Station 3MW/6MWh Energy Storage Project was successfully connected to the grid and put into operation. This project is also the first batch of photovoltaic storage in Xinjiang. The first one of the pilot projects to be completed and put into operation.” (link below) 

CGN is also blacklisted by USA thanks to Donald Trump, so If CGN needs batteries, they’ll have to shop local, especially since they are both located in Shenzhen.

CGN also has 4 power plants with 5 new ones under construction. CGN operates in other emerging energy industries like wind energy and solar energy, as well as more traditional industries like hydroelectricity. As of 2014 CGN operates power generation plant of the following capacities: nuclear 8.3 GW, wind 4.7 GW, hydro 4.0 GW and solar 600 MW.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_General_Nuclear_Power_Group#cite_note-cgn-20140127-3) CGN also operates in Brazil and Europe, AKA more CBAK Batteries

CBAK also has a partnership with China Southern Power Grid Integrated Energy Service: “cascade battery energy storage project jointly built by Shenzhen BAK Power Battery Co., Ltd. and China Southern Power Grid Integrated Energy Service Co., Ltd. was successfully put into operation after four months as a user-side energy storage project , Will be applied to industrial and commercial parks, and the main function is to achieve peak-shaving and valley-filling of electricity load and provide auxiliary power services. The project has realized multiple innovations at two levels of service model and solution, which has a milestone [industry](http://www.21cnev.com/index-caid-49.html) significance.” Link Below.

CBAK also helped hospitals during the pandemic when it was first starting. “BAK Battery provides core power for major hospitals in Hubei Province”

Lastly, CBAK has ANOTHER partnership for EV busses that most of are not aware of because it was posted on a chinese news website and could not be found on google. **“Shenzhen BAK Power Battery Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shenzhen Trigo International Holdings Co., Ltd. and CRRC Times Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd. to develop the Brazilian electric bus market. In the future, the three parties will cooperate and mutually benefit under the background of ""One Belt One Road"" to jointly develop the Brazilian electric bus market and promote Chinese manufacturing to go abroad.”  (Link below) Go ahead and check out CRRC on google, they are neat.**

Hopefully this helps!

I am long CBAT for the remainder of my life.

So I am working on a project recently, and I was scraping Reddit posts data to find out mentions for each ticker. I know that the scraper I used is not set up perfectly -- a lot of missing data happened, but I aggregated and scraped past month's top mentions. I use the first derivative to measure the interest for tickers and the second derivative to measure the growth of interest for tickers. So the chart is over here.

So NIO is the only stock with higher interests and growth of interest than its mention rank for daily, weekly, and monthly mentions -- what it means? It means that people are interested in it, and the talk around it is growing, and it snowballs. We can expect more discussion over NIO very soon. Why?

m6nba2,,StockMarket,post,1615939876,"Let’s discuss Electric Charging stocks like Chargepoint and Blink.Are these companies doomed unless they get bought out? Here is why i raise the question. Electric cars account for less than 2% of the current car market in the US as of 2021. Yes this number will grow and i’m sure it will be over 50% in due time. Possibly in a decade, plus or minus 5 years. Anyway Oil&Gas companies own all the prime real estate for fueling vehicles. Think of all the gas stations in your city that just happen to be in some of the most convenient cross streets near you. Right next to your grocery store, right next to your freeway, and so on. We associate these areas with refueling our vehicles. New buildings and construction are built with this infrastructure in mind. Some charging stations have penetrated gas station’s land, and that’s great. But at the end of the day, what is stopping Exxon or “insert massive petroleum company here” from making there own charging stations? What is stopping Exxon from developing Exxon Electric? I think it hasn’t been done yet because like i said electric vehicles still account for less than 2% of the US vehicles on the road. So the need isn’t there for them yet. Eventually the need will be there for them, and why would they allow another company to make money on the prime land that they own? When they can just develop their own Electric Charging station, on land that gets the most foot traffic already. If oil companies do make their own charging stations then they will have the competitive advantage with location. They have the locations that are ingrained in people’s psyche as areas to refuel their vehicle because it’s been that way since it was built. Infrastructure was built with these areas in mind. In some cases these places have been there almost 100 years. Unless these charging companies have charging tech that can’t be aproximated, i feel like ultimately the oil&gas companies could just evolve and make their own electric stations. 


What do you guys think?? Let me know your thoughts. 


I think EV’s are awesome by the way, i’m really excited for Lucid’s vehicle. I just think this is a logical concern to think about when investing in these charging companies.",

That’s not to say oil and gas companies might not create their own chargers, but I think the location of chargers doesn’t need to be where gas ones are.",

They currently have 73% of the market share in the US. They target the people that are driving across town and allow people to charge up when regularly they wouldn’t be able to. While yes I don’t believe they will be able to compete with faster chargers at gas stations or some other future model long distance charging locations, I do believe they have themselves in a fantastic niche for growth. With most of their chargers being free to use why wouldn’t you use them? And from a business standpoint, especially with the shift to more online shopping, what can you do to attract customers to choose you over your competitors, and may add a station. I do believe that Blink has potential, but is highly overvalued in comparison (I believe both are overvalued but the prices reflect the growth in the coming years). I think the real kicker to these types of companies for a short term play would be the current Biden administration’s desire to add 500,000 stations by 2030. Government contracts can be highly lucrative for businesses. With the infrastructure plan looking to enter the legislature in the coming month, I don’t think they’re a bad play at all.",['TGT']

m6nba2,gr6nhct,StockMarket,comment,1615940314,"I think you’re absolutely right.  There really isn’t anything special about a car charger:  they’re just a fancy AC plug.  You can charge your Tesla for instance from a standard 50A AC outlet with an adapter.  The only thing the chargers are really good for is public areas as they allow you to regulate who can use the charger (although people still buy them for their garages because Tesla is good at marketing).

It would be very easy for any oil/gas company to roll out charging stations at existing gas stations.  Assuming the electrical infrastructure is available (meaning there is sufficient capacity on the distribution circuit to handle the load of the cars charging).",['TSLA']
m68tn6,,StockMarket,post,1615900578,"5 Steps to a SPAC IPOThis post is based on a conversation I had with Niccolo De Masi who is very experienced in the SPAC business. He has done 4 SPACs so far. The purpose here is to get a better understanding of what the process is when a Startup goes from a private company to a publicly listed company with a SPAC IPO.  If you prefer to see it as a video instead it is available [here](https://youtu.be/Vb-iY08Uo8c). 

**#1 CHECK THE BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS**  
What does it take to SPAC IPO a business very much depends on the sector. You will be compared to your peer group. Requirements are pretty much the same as any other type of IPO.

**#2 GET TEAM AND PARTNERS READY FOR THE SPAC**  
You will be a public company when the deal closes, you have to be ready for that.

* Hire a CFO.
* Appoint auditors.
* Get the forecasts ready, be very conservative you must make the numbers.

You have a year to get compliant after you close the SPAC.

**#3 FIND A SPAC**  
Similar to finding any other investor. Meet a few and see what is a good match. You can hire a banker to find a SPAC, but be aware that there are a lot of people in the SPAC business that are learning on the job. Try and work with experienced people, people that have done a SPAC before. This goes for lawyers, accountants and advisors too, hire experienced people.

**#4 CLOSE THE DEAL WITH THE SPAC**   
First, a letter of intent is made with binding exclusivity and terms this is a shorter 8-10 page document. After that, the business combination agreement is made and this can be several hundred pages. Start talking to investors about raising more capital in a PIPE. The PIPE is short for Private Investment in Public Equity which is extra money into the transaction. PIPE is often used for secondaries. 

**#5 TELL THE WORLD AND START TRADING**  
The business combination agreement and PIPE agreements are signed and the announcement is made. At this point, anyone can buy shares in the SPAC even before the merger has happened. Once the SEC has approved the merger the shareholder of the SPAC vote and the merger actually happens. After that, the vote happens the ticker changes overnight and anyone can buy stock in this merged stock.",['DE']

One thing to take in consideration when getting into the stock market, is knowing when to sell and when to buy. Don’t be too greedy, do not waste the chance of selling a stock that has risen to a solid price just because you think it could go higher. What you can do instead is have a clear plan and target price based on your due diligence. If you’re expecting more growth than anticipated, don't get greedy, take your profit and let your initial investment ride.

Moreover when buying, never use anything other than your “play money” to trade with, especially when you’re just starting out. No job paycheck money, rent money, none of the essential day-to-day needs. Have a certain amount on the side you can trade with that won’t affect the livelihood of yourself or your family if it disappears.",['TGT']

m6sk5r,,StockMarket,post,1615956840,"INVE--NFC and RFID chip boom among several catalysts for grotwh.***Identiv has Many Irons in the Fire.*** It is a small company, but despite that, it has several different interesting businesses and markets--each of which on its own could potentially lead to huge profits for the company. 



***RFID/NFC chip business.*** 

This is the one most talked about on reddit.

The Fruit Company:  On its earnings calls, INVE has signaled a close relationship with the fruit company on NFC technology. Hopefully INVE is involved in the new iTag or whatever they will call it. Regardless, the iPhone's adoption of NFC beyond applepay has opened the floodgates for NFC consumer tech adoption. 

Just as the Sony Playstation was a blue-ray player leading to massive blue-ray growth, the iPhone is now an RFID and NFC reader and interface which will likely lead to a huge amount of growth in the space. I cannot oversell this point enough. Everyone has an RFID and NFC reader in their hands.  

Technology edge: INVE appears to have a competitive advantage in designing and manufacturing custom NFC and RFID chips. It certainly doesn't hurt that their relationship with Apple means they likely have intimate knowledge of the most used NFC/RFID reader's tech. Additionally, they have a unique ability to produce them on cardboard for environmental reasons as well.

Broader RFID market: The RFID market is booming with warehousing and shipping booming, tracking is becoming a necessity. 

Recent Results: INVE grew RFID revenues 100% yoy in 4Q. 
APU is growing as well, leading to possibly higher margins for INVE in the space. 

INVE is a leader in the space in a growing market with growing margins. Soon comes the huge profits hopefully.

(and UWB may add to the story here as well.)


***Premises Commercial, Switch to Cloud and recurring revenue.***

Identiv has revamped the way it sells its premises security systems. Instead of just selling its systems for installers to install, INVE is pushing a services model through the cloud. This system will allow the customer to get better value from Identiv with more support, increased flexibility in the system, and better data. 

Importantly, this generates recurring revenue. Instead of getting a 1 time 40-60% margin sale, INVE can recoup its entire cost and breakeven in its first year of revenue and continually generate that same revenue year after year. As the years go own sales will go from 0% margin to 50% margin to 67% margin to 75% margin to 80% margin. Each year INVE is able to keep the customer happy and upgrade it's systems, margins will go up and up and up.


***Government Business***

The government business is growing rapidly due to INVE’s technology edge. Both the Thursby Identity unit and the Hirsch velocity accesss control units are performing here. 
From the 4Q20 earnings transcript:
“In 2020, the federal government remains a strong growth driver. Our federal sales grew 30% year-over-year. Driven by our technology strength and by work from home and work mobile demand. We had key deployments at the Department of Energy, Treasury, NIST [ph] FBI and IRS offices nationwide, VA hospitals, multiple secret service facilities, Air Force bases worldwide and lots of others.” 

“In the area of federal government expansion we expect the 30% growth in our federal business to continue as the new administration emphasizes physical security and cyber security. With our product superiority, we expect to continue to grow our share even in a healthy spending federal government market. Among recent wins than the federal government, we're securing the Secret Service headquarters, field offices and all the places basic here [ph]. Our security leadership also is behind some rather urgent delivery orders we recently got for the U.S. House of Representatives in the capital. And we'll share more wins and expansions throughout 2021.”

INVE added  retired Navy Vice Admiral Robin Braun to its board in 2019, which should hopefully help the company better understand the federal market and market its technology leading products in a way that resonates with key government stakeholders


***in Summation***

INVE’s market cap of $200mn leaves a lot of room for growth, however as an investment, it has to start breaking even or generating profit or shares will be diluted by additional capital raised. Humphrey has mentioned $100mn a year in revenue as a possible breakeven inflection point, which INVE could hit this year.

My thesis is that INVE has many areas for growth and if INVE is able to have a big success in any one of its core areas, that growth could carry the entire business past the inflection point. In other words, it has Many Irons in the Fire!! Once INVE becomes profitable it will help to alleviate its relatively tight working capital situation and drive less restricted investment and decision making, in turn creating more growth + profits. 

I think it’s possible for INVE to achieve a Fortune 500 valuation in a decade. 


(i am not telling any of you cretans to buy the stock, just providing my take. The market is a fickle beast and INVE is a tiny unprofitable company, so anything can happen.)","['AAPL', 'PH']"

Recently Fidelity deposited $21,000+ of my money into someone else's account on Fidelity. It took me many hours of waiting on hold to get a real person to help me, but the first two I spoke with couldn't even tell me where the money was. I finally got to speak to a manager and he acknowledged that they deposited the money in the wrong account (some random person). I was told it would take two business days to transfer to my account, but two days later the transfer still hadn't occurred. I called customer service again (and again had to wait for over an hour) and spoke to a manger that said it would actually take 6+ business days. This is obviously unacceptable and I've decided to leave Fidelity. They have horrible customer service and the fact that they can't correct a massive mistake like this quickly demonstrates a lack of respect and care for their customers.

I had a few questions about switching brokerage firms. First, my understanding is that I get to choose where I have my SEP IRA, and so switching to a new firm (e.g., E-Trade) shouldn't be a problem. I own the law firm that deposits the SEP IRA (and we all decided to go with Fidelity since we all had Fidelity accounts already), but that doesn't prevent any of us from opening our individual SEP IRA accounts at another firm, correct?

Second, how difficult is it to transfer my person investment account and SEP IRA to a different brokerage firm? Do I have to sell out of all my positions or can they be directly carried over to a new firm as if nothing happened?

**Originally posted by u/pepsodont**

If you wanted a definitive proof about who CNBC plays for, we got ya, retards. Thanks to eagle sight of u/luxieto and help from u/halinxHalo we got not one, but two pieces of evidence that CNBC doesn't shy from raw and pure manipulation.

Original video: /watch?v=imRzHXRq80I - duration 04:37:06

CNBC video: /watch?v=d2DU6DXfGPM - duration 04:17:58

We're missing about 20 minutes.

""Ahh, you crayon-eating poop-brain, they edited out all the cuts, breaks and stuff like that"" I hear you saying. Yep! But also, CNBC fucks also did some extra shillwork on it.

At 02:38:19 (original video) - French Hill comes on and during his 5 minutes, he has doubts about separation of Citadel's businesses. In the CNBC version THERE IS NO FRENCH HILL. ERASED.

At 02:45:59 (original video) - Cindy Axne comes on and during her 5 minutes asks about RH and Citadel's spreads, business practices. CNBC keeps about 5% of her time in their version of the video, EVERYTHING ELSE GETS CUT.

You can go check it out yourselves, it's there for everybody to see.

We already knew they weren't clean, but tampering with a congressional hearing video? Is it just me or do you also smell desperation?

HODL monkey-brains, the end is near. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Many people wait for his famous ""YOLO UPDATE"" that he posts every now and then.

We all look at them and we can only dream of having such returns, having so much money, who wouldn't?

We all look and wonder if we'll ever make so much money in our lives, probably not, we think to ourselves.

But DFV was just a regular user of Reddit two years ago.

He was convinced of his ideas, had some cash, and fell in love with this company, as we all have.

Sure, he bought in at a much lower price, but that's not really what sets this man apart from most of us.

One of the secrets to his success was... his diamond hands and balls.

He was ridiculed for such a ""stupid"" investment - who would yolo his money in a ""failing brick and mortar company""?

He was subjected to FUD daily, he lived through some horrible earnings reports, and yet

he **held.**

He held because when a strong man/woman is convinced of his ideas nothing can distract him  - nothing can destroy him.

And that is what I also want to be. That is what I am going to be.

I believe in my ideas. I believe in myself. I know why I'm here today.

I won't let myself down just because I see some red days (or green days!).

No matter how things will turn out to be. No matter how red a day / week / month will be.

I will **hold.**

&#x200B;

*Edit: This is not just about GME, this is a general discussion*

*Edit II: Guys I'm not saying that diamond handing was all there is to DFV's success. Of course his extraordinary DD and his education did most of the work, but that doesn't mean that it was easy to hold through the tough times. What I'm trying to tell you is that his conviction and determination should be taken as an example*

As soon as congress quits dicking with it, and the professional traders are actually able to invest it will be much easier to read.

As other DD has shown Robinhood doesn’t actually buy your shares because they hold your stock ON MARGIN. In order to force them to buy your shares you need to perform the following changes in your app settings:

1. Click the user icon in the bottom right

2. Click “Investing”

3. Scroll all the way down to click the green words “Day Trade Settings”

4. Click the green words “Turn off instant settlement” at the very bottom

This will convert your account into a cash account and will force Robinhood to go into the market to buy your shares.

(EDIT: apparently for some people the “investing” menu is at the top right - just keep searching through the app until you find it, it’s gotta be somewhere)


EDIT: Additional instructions users sent to me in case you experience issues with the above:

1. alternative instructions for iphone

by u/ShowMeTheMoney7373

on iphones this is all i could find 1. settings (top left 3 horizontal bars) 2. help 3. contact support 4. trading 5. description: (1.)(a) i would like to switch to a cash acct. (2) (must also add these 3 issues otherwise they will receive an email asking these same questions and it will take longer): (b) confirm that you have $0.00 in unsettled funds and no pending transactions (c) your feedback on why you no longer want robinhood instant (d) your understanding that you might not be able to re-upgrade to RH Instant at a later date. 6. they will send an email confirming once it has been changed over to a cash acct

2. android might additionally require disabling options

by u/ShowMeTheMoney7373

back to android phones. they also have to disable options trading as it is only available for instant and gold. to remove 1. tap the person profile 2. tap menu icon- 3 horizontal bars 3. investing 4. options trading 5. remove options trading

3. TRANSFER (not sell!!!) away from Robin Hood. 

4. disabling margin in RH is not the same as turning off instant settlement!!

turning off instant settlement (as outlined in this post above) will convert your account to a cash account. disabling margin will not have that effect.

Just as a Fyi, once you do this you can not undo it, and it will take 3-5 days to be able to use your funds from stock sales or transfer.

m7h6uv,,wallstreetbets,post,1616035098,"What was the footprint of institutional trading in GME? Q from my written testimonyHi all 👋🏻. Alexis Goldstein here. During my testimony before the House Financial Services Committee today, I tried to flag some open questions I have. One of them is, what was the volume of trading in GME (and other meme stocks) by institutional players who, unlike retail, can trade “over the counter” (OTC) options (which they typically still hedge with listed stock). If regulators or Congress had a sense of the volumes of OTC options on GME that traded in periods of high volatility, that would give some insight into their overall footprint in the volatility. 

I elaborate on this a bit more in my written testimony if you’re interested:

m7h6uv,grbaffc,wallstreetbets,comment,1616036599,"Thanks for your candor and honest testimony.

The hearings seem to be overly concerned with gamification and payment for order flow.

Citizens do not care about gamification. We welcome the convenience of Robinhood. I wish an honest broker would follow suit. Payment for order flow - ok maybe that creates some issues. Still, it’s not THE issue. These are red herrings.

We are mad about the absurd short selling, cover-ups, the way media and government take sides, the way they paint retail as market manipulators (hypocrites), the way the game was stopped (the title of the hearing) by Robinhood.

**Short selling and asymmetric trade restricting should be the focus of these hearings.**Edit: and fines for crimes proportional to profit made off crimes.

I didn’t hear one mention of a short squeeze until we were 1.5 hearings in. It’s like everyone is pretending they don’t know what a short squeeze is.

Do you think Congress has a different agenda than the citizens or doesn’t understand?

What is happening with GameStop was and is incredible, but this is not a GameStop subreddit. I’m so tired of reading through the incredible DDs in this sub only to arrive at the comment section where some smooth brained dolt wrote, “not GME, downvote” or some bullshit like that. There’s already a GME subreddit and a daily mega thread to try to keep you people from running this sub into the ground.

So if you’re worried that your 5 shares @220 might not actually turn into 100k, make a Twitter account and start shilling GameStop there. I am aware that the GameStop play is still happening and don’t need the opinion of a 16 year old whose mommy still direct deposits money in their bank account every week.

m7plal,,wallstreetbets,post,1616070046,"The UWMC rocketFirst off: I'm very bullish on GME, and I won't sell a single share for this play. However, I had some cash laying around in my brokerage account that I owe in taxes. And I don't want to feel any pressure about the squeeze having to happen before X or Y, so that money won't be going into GME. The squeeze will happen when it happens, and I can confidently say I can hold my shares for however long I need to do so.

So during the last couple of weeks, I’ve seen UWMC being mentioned here. From what I understand, the company has pretty good fundamentals. They’re profitable, yada yada yada. However, I’m not looking for boomer stocks that give me a few percent of profit a year. I like rockets.But among the posts about UWMC, people were mentioning that there were a lot of options expiring on Mar 19. This piqued my interest. And I decided to take a look at the options chain myself.

I ran a script to collect the data from the Yahoo options chain on Mar 7th, and quickly realized that there are indeed a shit ton of calls. This is not a boomer stock. This is a rocket, primed for launch. I figured someone else was going to post about the options chain in a more exhaustive manner, but this never happened. However, the last date for optimal launch conditions is drawing close, and the stock price is finally seeing some nice upwards action. So I figured I'd take it upon myself to tell you all about the beautiful options chain.

Now, before we start, I should mention that my understanding of options is rather limited. Prior to the whole GME thing, “options” primarily made me think about the menu where you can change the graphics fidelity and your controls in a videogame. So keep that in mind as you read this. I’m not the ideal person to be posting this.

The UWMC options chain had (as of Mar 7th - sorry about the outdated data, didn’t run the script since then, and the Yahoo IV seems to be scuffed right now) a total of 501,471 calls, with strike prices ranging from $1 to $25. As we all probably know by now, each call contract is worth 100 shares. This means that there were call contracts out there worth 50,147,100 shares.For a stock which has a public float of only \~90 million. Let that sink in. There are calls for literally 55% of the float.

I also went ahead and calculated approximate deltas for the various calls in order to calculate to which extent these calls are likely hedged. With the price at the time ($8.68), roughly 11.3 million shares would have been held by call writers, assuming all of them hedge according to delta, and calls worth 38.9 million shares would have been unhedged.

At a price of $10, the number of hedged shares should go up to roughly 16 million.

At $12, that number would be \~23 million.

At $14, \~28.9 million. At this point, there are still \~21.2 million shares that are unhedged.

And this just keeps going as the price reaches new heights. Basically RKT all over.

Now, the deltas would be slightly different today seeing as the delta calculation takes time until expiry into account, and a lot of the calls expire tomorrow, but the situation should still be *very* similar. Also, all of the calls aren’t written by market makers or by people who delta-hedge, but from what I understand, Market Makers do write the majority of call options.

TLDR:There are call options out there worth roughly 55% of the public float of UWMC. Potential for a massive gamma squeeze starting if the price goes up just a couple of dollars. EZ 2-bagger *with shares* before the week is over.

If the price doesn't go up soon enough, UWMC is apparently still a solid company, according to other posts on this sub. Boomer profits, maybe a 2-bagger with shares before the year is over.

Positions: 150 shares @ $9.06. No options because I’m not rich enough to set up an account at an american broker, and I can’t find any european brokers that offer options for american stocks.

This is obviously not investing advice. I barely understand how options work, and eat crayons for breakfast.

Edit: Market is open, yahoo IV is unscuffed. So I could get some fresh data.

Total open interest  is 543,817 for calls across all strike prices and dates. Table below is assuming 100% of calls are hedged according to delta. This is obviously not the case in reality, but I'm not sure what percentage would be a reasonable assumption, so just posting the raw results from my script here. Also, keep in mind my deltas aren't 100% correct, but rather just approximations. I'm too smoothbrained for using the real black-scholes algorithm.

So there is a huge bubble in America. 35% of all your money had been printed in the last year, money printer goes brrrr with every other stimmy, interest rates are stupidly low and your government is practically out of options while in the middle of the fucking pandemic.
If they raise interest rates economy goes kaboom. If the keep printing money the world will eventually won’t care about dollar because it won’t have any value whatsoever and the whole thing will go kaboom. 
And since America already avoided two downfalls of economy since 2008 by lowering interest rates and printing money and throwing it on people the fall will be grand. 
Do you remember what was happening before the 2008 fall? Ordinary people started getting into investing and they were buying shitty bonds, pouring money into financial markets, resulting in big inflation of stock prices. Just like we see it now with GME, AMC, cry**o etc.
The problem is, America likes to think the are too big to fall so how can America start producing a shitload of goods, start making real money and keep all their money’s worth? The only way is war because that shit is profitable AF.
And that’s not just America the same things are happening in Europe, it’s just on smaller scale. 
So are you guys aware of this or not? 
TLRD: the world is fucked and we are in for a ride

EDIT: YES EUROPE IS ALSO FUCKED I KNOW
EDIT2: My whole point is to find how are we gonna make some money while we enjoy the ride down or at least how can we apply some financial lube to not get fucked THAT hard
EDIT3 : Jesus fucking Christ I knew there are retards here but I didn’t think they will be that retarded. I am not a doomsday idiot. I see an opportunity for making money.

m79wdx,,wallstreetbets,post,1616013130,"Why the $GME MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) is real and why it is scary for the rest of the marketSo I tried to post this on r/investing and r/stocks but I don't think I meet their karma requirements so I am gonna start this post here.

This post is gonna be long and in order to understand it, you need to understand how market makers works. If you don’t understand that concept, that’s fine. A simple google search will yield sources better than me, that can provide you a basic understanding of market makers and short selling. So try doing a quick search to educate yourself then come back here

# The GME-market wide Correlation

So for anybody that has been paying attention to the market charts since December, it has become very obvious that GME is inversely correlated with the rest of the market.

Hence, when the market has major red days across multiple sectors, GME is still green among a sea of red. And when GME goes down the rest of the market goes up. Anybody with a basic broker app can look at the 3 month charts and see this correlation.

When you align charts of GME since December, with most major securities on the NYSE and especially within the Nasdaq, it’s like looking at a heart beat scan and this heart beat is rapidly heading towards major cardiac arrest

# So why is this happening?

Well the simplified explanation is this. When this squeeze bleeds the financial institutions (like Melvin capital for example), it forces them to sell off their long term positions across the whole market or else they risk getting margin called.

So for example, when GME goes up 10 points they gotta liquidate millions of dollars in their AAPL positions to pay off their short position. This is pretty basic stuff

# But this isn’t a normal Short Squeeze

The main talking point across all of the investing subreddits and news outlets, was the fact that GME’s short percentage reached a height of **140%**

But what does a 140% float mean?

Did the hedge funds short/borrow more shares than even existed?

Well yes, that’s called naked shorting but it’s more complicated than that.

# How Naked Shorts work

When a naked short is created, it basically creates a derivative of a real share for the borrower. So when you see 140% short percentage that doesn’t mean all available shares of GME were borrowed for shorting, it means when these institutions (Melvin) heavily shorted GME, the Market Makers (Citadel) **created** shares out of thin air, and **tethered** them to the real shares that were borrowed. These made up shares are synthetic shares, they don’t actually exist but once they are created they are then traded as if they are real shares.

This process sounds absurd and more like a conspiracy but this is really how it works and how all security derivatives have always worked on the market and this process was further confirmed in the GameStop hearing today by Dennis Kelleher. I believe you can see this conversation within the first hour of the hearing, sorry I don’t have a time stamp but today’s hearing is worth watching if you have the time.

# The Big Short

So an easy way to understand this is like comparing these naked shorts to “Synthetic CDO’s” from the 2008 crisis. I’m using synthetic CDO’s as an example because they are a financial derivative that most people are familiar with from the movie, “The Big Short.” These naked short derivatives basically function in the same manner as synthetic CDO’s.

So market makers like Citadel and financial institutions like Melvin Capital, trade these synthetic shares back and forth on the market as if they were real shares.

This would mean these financial institutions have become quite leveraged swapping these synthetic shares back and forth all over the market because in reality, **they are trading an imaginary security that is directly correlated with a real one, and the real borrowed shares are already losing them money**

# Now to talk about the current squeeze

It is dangerous to take on a short position because you have taken a position in a trade with **Infinite risk**. This is how short squeezes happen, if the price is driven up, the short seller has to take money out of their pocket to pay the lender, which then further increases the price of a share, and this back and forth is the driving force for a squeeze.

The current price of GME is obviously a result of a short squeeze. Anybody with a brain knows that GME is not fundamentally worth its current price of this post, at $215/share, but it’s price has rocketed up because the short sellers have to buy back their borrowed shares which then propel the price further up.

# But here is the the important part

The current squeeze is only a product of the real shares borrowed, the naked shares have not come to maturity yet even tho they are directly tethered to the real shares because the **synthetic shares only become “real” when the short position completely closes or is margin called.**

This means, the synthetic shares will act like a multiplier upon what will already be an absurd number.

So you don’t need to be Albert Einstein to see that the final number on this squeeze will be truly ridiculous, once the synthetic shares come to fruition.

We already know these synthetic shares have no intrinsic value because they are tied to the real borrowed shares, and those borrowed shares are already costing financial institutions serious money. But that doesn’t stop these synthetic GME shares from getting traded around by market makers because they are treated as if they are real shares.

So The MM’s are essentially playing a game of hot potato right now, except they are actually passing around an Atomic Bomb.

# Now why it’s scary for the rest of the market

So if you’ve been following to this point, you might be able to see that the final payday for GME could be historic. 

**Which sounds great for GME holders but here is the reality of this equation... I don’t think there are any institution that will be capable of footing the final bill for the GME shorts. The final payout would likely bankrupt Jeff Bezos.**

So this is gonna likely result in these financial institutions committing massive sell offs (I’m talking in the billions of dollars) across the entire market in order to pay off the final fee, and I don’t think these inevitable sell offs will provide enough liquidity to payout the short cost.

I believe, with great conviction, when GME truly takes off it will cause, a major market-wide correction across all sectors.

# The Conclusion

Nobody can say what the exact date of the MOASS will be and what the final GME number will be because nobody but the shorts know the details of their deals (maybe the government should consider forcing more disclosure in the short market).

I can speculate and say that the MOASS will likely occur by the end of April because the way these contract expiry dates are usually set. And It’s possible the financial institutions could have repositioned their shorts further down the road to buy more time.

However, I can say 2 things with absolute certainty

* We are witnessing history, this whole thing is already resulting in many academic studies, further government intervention, and future movies/documentaries
* **There are no retail brokers in America that will be capable of paying out retail investors when GME reaches the peak so we will see January 28th happen all over again.**

I do not care what broker you have, fidelity, E\*TRADE, Schwab, or robinhood, etc.  They are gonna be forced to shut down GME buys (and very possibly sells) just like RH did on January 28th. When the number spikes again nobody will have the liquidity to move the money required for the MOASS

**And I know everybody hates Robinhood but in my personal opinion, I believe they are just the patsy for this whole thing.** The entire worth of most retail brokers will not be enough to payout the MOASS to retail investors so I can guarantee we will see traders shut down GME buys when it takes off like in January. 

# THIS WILL NOT BE THE BROKERS FAULT, THE MARKET MAKERS AND HEDGE FUNDS SHOULD BE THE ONES FOOTING THE BILL, EVEN IF THAT MEANS SELLING OFF EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE IN THEIR BUILDING TO DO SO.

Mainstream Brokers only have so much money to provide the liquidity needed to move billions of trades a day, they are not equipped to deal with something this insane.

# So Why did I type up this long ass post?

If you think I’m just a crazy person, that’s fine. I don’t take it personally. I’m just making this post because I believe this current squeeze is mainly responsible for the market wide volatility we have witnessed these past 3 months. I just wanted to make this post to bring caution to retail traders.

I know GME is a “meme stock” so it’s easy to discredit and it’s fun watching this David vs Goliath story but I believe this will have very real effects across the whole market so proceed with caution on your trades until this squeeze reaches a conclusion, **ESPECIALLY IF YOU DEAL WITH NAKED OPTIONS**

If you read this whole thing, thanks. Please let me know if there is any corrections I should make.

TLDR: just skim the bold points ya lazy fuck lol

Edit: gonna have to turn off notifications now lol. So I’m sorry if I don’t reply, maybe later. 

But most importantly I’m no professional, I’m just a guy with an interest in the world of finance. So don’t take this post as gospel. I wanted to start this thread for the discussion and while I do strongly personally believe the MOASS is real, I appreciated the counter points.

Thanks for the laughs and genuine discussion","['GOOGL', 'AAPL', 'NDAQ']"

I want to use this darkest of hours to tell you that not all is lost. Nothing is lost (until you sell in fact!). Of course I have no idea what I'm talking about - I'm really no one to trust in financial advice, so be aware. 

But still I am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining. Trends in stocks need corrections, that's basic DOW-theory. And how much do they correct in general? A 0.5 Fib-retracement correction is very usual in almost all trends. They even sometimes correct a fib-retracement below. 

So when you're looking at my chart now (very fancy, colors!, buy!) you will see that we're pretty exact around that retracement now. Furthermore price tried to go under EMA50 but directly went up again to the exact position of EMA50. Where are we now?  Correct, almost at EMA50 but NOT below. This is a hell of a resistance and we're not letting it fall below my fellow apes!

Furthermore EMA100 and EMA200 are still showing upward movement, which is also good. 

Last but not least MACD aims for its zero-line and might turn positive. You ask when? Hm, if you look at the MACD trend it might be tomorrow, Friday 03/19 (and we are all hoping for a beginning squeeze on that day, don't we?!)

As you can see, from my perspective everything is still fine. For disclosure, I'm stuck in the upper 300s in GME, and I won't sell before we reach at least four digits! 

TL:DR: Trend is still fine, EMA50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement tomorrow, Friday 03/19 or coming Monday. I like the stock and you should like it too.

He was asked about if he is trying to Democratize stock trading, and we small time investors are not given the same advantages as hedge funds, has he failed.


Issue 1: he states he is not sure what advantages hedge funds have. 

My question is, if you run a financial institution, how do you not realize what advantages a hedge fund has over retail traders.


Issue 2: When he stated this, the interviewer clarified by saying hedge funds could buy a stock that his customers could not. He then babbled about how hedge funds had lost money as well.

He never admits that this was an advantage to hedge funds, and in a round about way defends his actions while never answering the question.


Issue 3: There is a weird camera zoom change at 44:54 that is in a pause of the middle of a sentence.

Was that the actual end of the sentence, or did they go back and edit this? Why zoom at this point?",

Option sellers have sold SO MANY calls on RKT for March 19th that they are seriously in trouble if the price moves! In fact if the price starts moving it's entirely possible the chain reaction can bring the price to the maximum strike, $62.89 at which point option sellers will lose **$1 BILLION DOLLARS...** They don't want this to happen!  


If you're wondering WHY they are trying SO HARD to keep the price NOT MOVING it's based on Max Pain Theory:  


*The Maximum* ***Pain theory*** *states that an* ***option's*** *price will gravitate towards a* ***max pain*** *price, in some cases equal to the strike price for an* ***option****, that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless.*  


The price of $RKT where there is MAX PAIN and OPTION HOLDERS LOSE THE MOST is $**23.89.**  


Very interesting how they are battling hard to keep the price here! Let's see the price as of 11am EST... **$24.22.**  


Most calls are at a strike of **$28.89**  
Most puts are at a strike of **$23.89**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Look at the massive options cascade that could trigger huge losses as the price moves up. 

&#x200B;

[Insane open interest volumes but most are OUT THE MONEY](https://preview.redd.it/wohphdxkxsn61.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=f09b2a5ccec022293e5c1b8aef2e182679708b5d)

**$25 strike** has pretty big open interest of 38,349 followed closely by **$28.89** at 53,885.   


**TLDR:** We're seeing option sellers try really hard to maintain the price in a very narrow channel where they LOSE the least amount of money.   


This is pure price manipulation.   


If they lose control of even a few percent the options chain and gamma ramp can result in a potential $1,000,000,000 in losses for option sellers.

2. **They also announced GDP growth from 4.2% to 6.5% for 2021**
3. **Jay Farner (CEO of RKT) announced two big tweets this week that they just had their best weekend ever on record and have increased their broker market share.**

All of this data seems like positive data right? So why is $RKT shitting the bed? Because hedgies are manipulating the shit out of the stock in anticipation of the 3/19 upcoming options chain. They need the share price to close the week low otherwise they could get squeezed. Read this post on what a sell wall is and how it works: (link will be in comments)

In conclusion, I like the stock long term on the fundamentals. I think $RKT is a solid company that is going to grow this year.

I also fundamentally like Jay Farner their CEO. He is an entrepreneur who has put 25 years of his life into this company and had a great interview on Fox recently.

$RKT is currently trading around 6X earnings. Wall Street thinks they are not going to be able to outgrow their performance from 2020. If $RTK shows growth this year, the stock has tons of upside.

They ended 2020 with 8% of the US mortgage market and plan is to grow to 25% by 2030:

I like the stock long term. Short squeeze is just icing on the cake.

TLDR: RKT being held down by hedge dick heads, if we get past sell wall we can cause a gamma and a short squeeze which = 🚀🚀🚀","['TWTR', 'FOX']"

m7pv4e,,wallstreetbets,post,1616070999,"Confused with $GME over 100% institutional ownership ?, guide how to read ownership filings🦍🦍🦍 can afford 2.5k a month Bloomberg terminal but can't read.

***Download link at bottom, contains the complete list of 13F, D/G and NP filings for $GME***

Two things, while short positions are not reported in the 13F, as Ms Alexis Goldstein (u/dontfightthevol) has pointed out,  however the PUT options hedgies hold are indeed included.

Institutional Ownership over 100% is not a hedgies conspiracy, Example of other stocks with over 100% ownership such as Paypal and Salesforce

PYPL : Institutional Shares	1,364,784,714 - 116.48% (ex 13D/G)

CRM : Institutional Shares	1,049,782,250 - 114.73% (ex 13D/G)

The over 100% ownership report can be caused by the following

**1. Different Report Type**

**13D and 13G**

The 13D and 13G forms are ""beneficial ownership"" forms. The primary purpose of these forms is to understand control of a company. To that end, the 13D and G forms do not just disclose the shares directly held by an investor, but also shares indirectly held (but controlled) by that institution. These indirect shares include all the shares held by the clients of financial advisors. Another requirement of the beneficial ownership forms is that they include related parties to the funds.

For example, the firm called ""Point72"" that you are probably most familiar with is Point72 Asset Management, LP. However, there are also related entities Point72 Capital Advisors and Point72 Asia (Hong Kong) Limited. When Point72 Capital Advisors files a 13G, these related parties might also be found on the filings. For an example of this, see this 13G filing for Pacira Pharmaceuticals. If you look at that 13G, you'll find five different entities listed on that filing (including Steve Cohen).

**13F**

In comparison, the 13F filings are not as concerned with disclosing the control of a company, but rather the holdings of a fund. Every fund with over 100M assets under management is required to file a 13F that discloses their positions. The types of securities disclosed in this form include long equities, call options, and put options. Short positions and cash are not disclosed. One of the key differences between the 13D/G filings and the 13F filings is that whereas the 13D/G filings can be made as groups (with related parties), the 13F filings can not. This means that there are frequent instances where a insitution might file a 13G and a 13F diclsosing different shares for the same security.

**NP**

Form N-PORT is the reporting form that is to be used for monthly reports of Funds other than money market funds and SBICs under section 30(b) of the Act, as required by rule 30b1-9. under the Act (17 CFR 270.30b1-9). This form, filed by registered management investment companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) organized as Unit Investment Trusts, is used to report on a fund’s portfolio. Money market funds and small business investment companies (SBICs) are excluded.

&#x200B;

**2. Different Filing Date and deadlines**

The deadline is for Date X for the effective Period Y. For example Fund A submits it's report at 1/26 then later sold it on 2/1, filed the report on 1/27. Fund B bought it at 1/27 and filed the report at 2/3. When financial data service tally all the report it sometimes tally both holding on Fund A and Fund B.

**Filing Deadlines**

* 13F - Within 45 days after the end of each quarter.
* 13D - Within 10 days of owning 5% of a company, and within 10 days of any material change thereafter.
* 13G - Annually on February 15.
* 4 - Within 2-3 days of the transaction.
* NP - Last business day of every month

&#x200B;

**3. Synthetic ownership**

Some Fund are long the shares via call options

&#x200B;

**4. Short selling (What** 🦍🦍🦍 **want to hear)**

Assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.

m7pv4e,grd4okz,wallstreetbets,comment,1616078448,"I think one thing fascinating to me is that, in comparison to other stocks (AAPL, AMZN, AMC, TSLA, RKT, etc.) the institutional ownership is listed as being around 70-80% for those stocks. Not a single stock in Bloomberg showed 100% institutional ownership.

For GME, it's 130%. That's definitely an oddity not shared by other stocks, even stocks that are shorted pretty heavily. It's these indications that sort of raise a red flag to me on this, that this still hasn't imploded nor can it really just ""fade away"".","['AAPL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA']"

m7s1os,,wallstreetbets,post,1616077834,"$RKT *** 3/19 gains if shares are bought!Copying and pasting this from HumbleHubris:

**RKT looks like a sterling investment and if you're going to own RKT you might as well own it now, cash out Friday, and then reinvest all of the gains and be even more rich when this Company is worth 12 figures** OR if investing isn't your thing, then I hear gourd futures literally cannot go tits up

tl;dr: 23M short shares are available to sell. If those are bought, plus whatever naked shorts they're willing to gamble, then the option chain powder keg gets lit 💥

I'm paraphrasing from those smarter than me (u\\jn\_ku u\\megahut u\\freakypheobe)

RKT is an undervalued behemoth so buy and hold shares in your 401K and you'll be rich sooner rather than later.

What is interesting for 3/19, however, is that the option chain is a powder keg. It is so explosive that MM went balls to the wall and just pinned the price so hard at $24.50 that it looked like trading was halted. They did this after

* the housing report came out bullish,
* the Fed said no rate hike,
* the Fed said they're going to keep buying MBS,
* RKT CEO said their competition's anti-competitive behavior backfired and RKT is doing gang busters broker business.

The obvious market manipulation is desperation because there are not enough shares to cover those calls. There may be 15% to 30% (16M - 30M shares) of free float.

So why $24.50, because any lower and they're negative on the puts, any higher sets off a chain reaction where $25c print, then $27c, then $30c. We're sitting at Max Pain. Here is the detonation sequence:

* At $25.50, there are 8M shares ITM
* At $29, there are 20M shares ITM *...there may be only 16M shares in free float*
* At $32, MM may have to buy up ALL of the synthetic longs to cover the options

If those calls are ITM and naked (I'm thinking they're naked), the option writers will be margin called. Not *can* be margin called, they *will* be because these are monthly contracts and liquidity can be called on option contracts T+2. That ""T"" is Friday for DTCC and brokers are not holding the bag so they're margin calling as soon as contracts turn red.

So how do we move the price up $1 dollar. One! Solitary! Dollar! to start the lunch sequence? We have to blow past the sell walls that are floor to ceiling shorts. There are 15M shorts ready to be sold and another 7M that are ready to be borrowed. If those shares get bought, then it's just naked shorts and price gains while the option writers shit their pants waiting for the phone to ring

Resulting in a net selling of shares if price sits around this price level

With the current structure of the OI strikes, expiries and underlying price, $GME will be bleeding shares, dumped by MM because delta is decreasing due to theta. This phenomenon is particular in high IV stocks with a concentration of OI strikes above the underlying nearing expiry, ie like $GME.

To get back to Monday's price level, you guys need to either NET BUY 400MM USD(400 thousand **🦍🦍🦍** with 1k 🍌🍌🍌 each)  worth of shares (not on RH since they may not be actually buying it but just give you an IOU instead), or Gamma up the ATM and near OTM options for 3/19 and 3/26. No, I'm not a HF shill or  a thetagang vampire, I'm being real, your stimmy won't be enough to move the market  by only  buying shares at this price point.

Ms Alexis Goldstein agrees that options probably contributed most of the volatility

   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".
